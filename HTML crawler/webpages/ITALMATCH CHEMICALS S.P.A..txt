Contava pochi dipendenti, circa venti miliardi di lire di fatturato e trattava derivati del fosforo con grandi potenzialità di diversificazione e possibilità di nuove applicazioni molto più promettenti, come i ritardanti di fiamma e i lubrificanti per auto. Dopo 25 anni, abbiamo raggiunto 1.200 dipendenti in 16 paesi, abbiamo chiuso il 2022 con un fatturato di 850 milioni”, racconta Sergio Iorio , CEO & Founder di Italmatch Chemicals. “Ricerca e innovazione sono stati driver fondamentali, che fin dal principio hanno permesso una diversificazione e la trasformazione di Italmatch da fornitore in mercati di nicchia a leader globale nella chimica di specialità. Oggi, questa propensione all’innovazione ci permette di essere già posizionati nelle filiere a maggior tasso di crescita: energie rinnovabili, dall’eolico al fotovoltaico alla geotermia; la mobilità elettrica e le batterie di ultima generazione; le soluzioni di economia circolare per il recupero e riuso di metalli e materie prime”.

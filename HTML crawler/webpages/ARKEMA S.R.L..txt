« In a context in continuity with that of Q4 2023, financial performance was solid and EBITDA close to that of first-quarter 2023. Arkema focused on tightly managing its operations and continuing to make progress on its main ongoing projects, in order to reap the initial benefits thereof this spring.

The start of 2024 was also marked by a significant new milestone for our Adhesive Solutions segment, with the highly value-creative planned acquisition of Dow's adhesives business for flexible packaging. With its leading technologies and top-quality manufacturing facilities, this product line will perfectly complement our offering in high-tech industrial adhesives, as was the case with the acquisition of Ashland’s adhesives two years ago.

Finally, we are continuing our efforts to decarbonize our value chain with the signature of several new green electricity supply agreements. » stated Thierry Le Hénaff , Chairman and CEO of Arkema .

By day, Benoît leads the Mobility Market at Bostik 's Durable Goods BU, while Vincent manages the Amines business at Arkema 's Thiochemicals BU. But when the suits come off, these two are masters of a different kind of strategy – fencing! En garde!

🤺 Benoît's journey into fencing began at the tender age of six when he traded in his flute for a foil, inspired by the swashbuckling adventures of Zorro.

🤺 Meanwhile, Vincent, also captivated by the allure of swordplay, took up fencing at seven, drawn to the sport's unique blend of agility and strategy.

⚔️ For Vincent, fencing is a thrilling mix of explosive energy and precise control, not just about physical prowess but also about outsmarting your opponent and staying one step ahead.

⚔️ Benoît revels in the technical challenge of perfecting each movement, it's all about mindset and determination.

Just like in business, where every move counts, they approach each match with focus and resilience, never backing down from a challenge.

So, whether they're sealing deals in the boardroom or scoring points on the fencing strip, Benoît and Vincent prove that success is all about strategy, adaptability, and a touch of daring! #Talents 93 4 commenti Consiglia Commenta Condividi Arkema 210.952 follower 2 settimane Modificato Segnala post 📢 Bostik joins hands with the Bovelander Foundation to empower communities in India 🤲

We are continuously improving the service we provide through our app to comply with increased accessibility standards, guidelines, and to make the browsing experience better for everyone. Conformance status The app uses the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defined requirements to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. Accessibly App is following the best guidelines and is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Technical information Accessibly App is an app supported in Shopify and Wordpress environments. The app relies on the following technologies: HTML CSS JavaScript NodeJs MongoDB Accessibly App features When a site has Accessibly App i ac-h4 installed, the website can be adjusted with keyboard navigation using the “tab” key (WCAG 2.1/2.1.1). Additionally, see the list of all provided Accessibly App features and tools for better website experience: Zoom | WCAG 2.1 / 1.4.4 This feature enables users to enhance the size of the text to up to three times the original text for better text readability. Bigger cursor Makes the cursor bigger and more prominent. Increases the size for better site browsing. Invert colors Invert the colors of the website content. For those with decreased vision, the high contrast greatly helps to read the site better. Tweak Contrast | WCAG 2.1 / 1.4.6 This feature lets users manually select from two options: to enhance the contrast of the website or to decrease the contrast. Tweak Brightness | WCAG 2.1 / 1.4.6 This feature lets users update the brightness on the site. The content can either be made brighter or darker. Grayscale | WCAG 2.1 / 1.4.6 Users can turn on grayscale, making the website content appear only in shades of gray. This benefits people with visual impairment. Reading Line Add a supportive reading line to the site. Readable fonts Convert the fonts available on-site to one of the most easily readable fonts: Helvetica. Alt Text and Images Ability to read alt text of images. As of now, our tool has added a feature where alt descriptions for images without them are generated using Google's Vision AI . In the event that you haven't manually written these image descriptions yourself, this greatly helps people with visual impairment browse your site. Tooltips | WCAG 2.1 / 2.5.3 Add labels to images that contain a written description of the image. Highlight links Highlight links to make them more prominent. Hide images Hide images on the site. This provides better site readability for people with visual impairment. Read page A feature that allows a voice to read the text on your site out loud to visitors.

BUSINESS TREND NOMINE SUSTAINABILITY CULTURE DESIGN ENGLISH / MF Fashion / News / Business / Prada e Zegna investono nella filiera con Luigi Fedeli e figlio Business Prada e Zegna investono nella filiera con Luigi Fedeli e figlio Dopo l’acquisizione congiunta della maggioranza di Filati Biagioli Modesto nel 2021, i due gruppi luxury guidati rispettivamente da Patrizio Bertelli e da Gildo Zegna tornano a scommettere sul Made in Italy. Le società hanno rilevato ciascuna una quota del 15% dello storico maglificio monzese, specializzato nei filati di pregio, e i manager entreranno a far parte del cda. Luigi Fedeli manterrà il ruolo di presidente e ad e deterrà il restante 70% del capitale di FEDERICA CAMURATI tempo di lettura 2 min Leggi dopo Da sinistra, Gildo Zegna e Patrizio Bertelli Il Gruppo Prada e il Gruppo Ermenegildo Zegna portano avanti la loro scommessa sulla filiera made in Italy. Le due società luxury hanno raggiunto un accordo per l’acquisizione di una partecipazione di minoranza pari al 15% ciascuno del maglificio Luigi Fedeli e figlio srl . Con quest’operazione, Gildo Zegna , presidente e amministratore delegato di Zegna, e Patrizio Bertelli , presidente e amministratore esecutivo di Prada, entreranno a far parte nel consiglio di amministrazione della società. Luigi Fedeli , presidente e amministratore delegato della storica azienda di filati di pregio fondata a Monza nel 1934, oggi guidata dalla terza generazione, deterrà il restante 70% del capitale sociale e continuerà a esercitare il suo ruolo. Per i due grandi nomi del fashion & luxury tricolore si tratta del secondo accordo in pochi anni. Già nel 2021, infatti, con l’acquisizione congiunta di una quota di maggioranza della Filati Biagioli Modesto spa , Zegna e Prada avevano dato prova della visione comune dei loro numeri uno nel voler dare continuità, preservare il know how e proseguire nel creare valore per il Made in Italy nel mondo in nome dell’artigianalità e dell’innovazione. «Questo accordo per l’ingresso del gruppo Prada nel capitale sociale di Fedeli rappresenta un investimento strategico volto a preservare il know how e la tradizione di un’eccellenza italiana nella maglieria di filati di pregio», ha affermato Patrizio Bertelli. «Ancora una volta, dopo l’acquisizione della Filati Biagioli sempre assieme al gruppo Zegna, ci impegniamo a fare sistema nell’industria della moda e del Made in Italy. Questa operazione rispecchia la filosofia che il gruppo adotta da sempre, ovvero il controllo diretto della filiera in ogni singola fase del processo produttivo, che ci consente inoltre di accelerare su temi importanti quali la tracciabilità delle materie prime e la trasparenza della nostra catena di fornitura». L’operazione è sospensivamente condizionata all’ottenimento delle necessarie autorizzazioni da parte della Commissione europea ai sensi del Regolamento ce 139/2004. «Negli anni, l’acquisizione di storiche aziende italiane ha consentito al gruppo Zegna di costituire una piattaforma di realtà tessili del lusso garantendo la più alta qualità e salvaguardando l’unicità dell’artigianalità italiana», ha dichiarato anche Gildo Zegna. «L’attenzione di Fedeli alla massima qualità e ai valori della sostenibilità, ci ha avvicinato. Questa acquisizione mi rende particolarmente orgoglioso perché oltre ad aggiungere alla nostra filiera un’altra eccellenza, sottolinea il nostro impegno a contribuire alla crescita di Fedeli e a preservare e valorizzare l’artigianalità del Made In Italy. Sono affiancato per la seconda volta in due anni da un grande imprenditore dell’industria della moda italiana con cui condivido la passione per la filiera e l’ambizione di fare sistema tra gruppi italiani». Attraverso il suo marchio omonimo commercializzato in 13 boutique e oltre 400 negozi multimarca nel mondo, Fedeli è una presenza consolidata nel knitwear di alta gamma. «Credo fortemente nell’Italia e negli accordi italiani, e le possibili sinergie identificate con Prada e Zegna si integrano perfettamente con la visione di Fedeli nella continua ricerca di qualità, artigianalità e innovazione», ha sottolineato Luigi Fedeli. «Sono felice di poter unire le forze con due gruppi leader nel settore e poter così continuare a sviluppare un’eccellenza tutta italiana».

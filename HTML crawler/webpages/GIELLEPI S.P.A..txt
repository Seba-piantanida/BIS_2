Reject All Save Accept All Skip to content Company Science&Innovation Ingredients News Contact Contatti A trusted ingredient supplier since 1998, today Giellepi delivers science-backed branded ingredients to the most innovative wellness and nutrition companies in the industry. Our ingredients Our story 1998 Our history begins in Milan with the foundation of Giellepi Chemicals Srl. At the time, the company was specialized in the distribution of intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the local market. 2000 Soon after starting its operations, thanks to the extensive experience in the health and food industry of Carlo Terruzzi, one of the company’s shareholders, Giellepi began to devote itself to the sales of raw materials for the nutraceutical industry. 2010 After focusing for several years on high-quality specialty ingredients and the development of ready-to-market food supplements, all the commercial activities of the APIs division were appointed to a separate entity called Giellepi Pharmaceuticals Srl. 2010-2020 Under the Terruzzi family full ownership, Giellepi S.p.A. expanded its global network of strategic partnerships with a focus on providing branded ingredients backed by science and eventually becoming a leading company in the Italian probiotic and nutraceutical markets. At the same time the company was recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the B2B supplement and medical device space offering to international brand owners clinically supported finished products under exclusive license. 2021 Following years of success with products sold in more than 35 Countries and dozens of clinical trials published to support its formulations, Giellepi decided to sell its private label business unit to further strengthen its commitment as a leading ingredient partner in the nutraceutical space. 2023 Today, with the same passion and professionality that has distinguished us from the beginning, as family-owned business, we proudly represent in the Italian market some of the leading nutraceutical raw material manufactures and at the same time we offer to our global customers a range of Giellepi proprietary ingredients. For nearly 25 years, Giellepi has been known for providing the highest quality, safe and effective nutritional ingredients available. As one of the largest nutraceutical ingredient suppliers in Italy, and with more than a decade experience in licensing private label supplements and medical devices to pharmaceutical and nutraceutical companies, nowadays Giellepi stands out in the crowded global market thanks to its scientific-based approach and customer-oriented attitude. Our mission Giellepi’s mission is to add value to our customer’s brand through innovative clinically validated solutions that deliver health and wellness benefits. Our vision We aim to become a reference point for the global nutraceutical and dietary supplement markets in terms of quality, innovation and science. In doing so our core values drive us in everything we do. Teamwork We deeply understand only a hardworking team can make a big difference. Innovation Always seeking innovative solutions to help our customers to formulate the best products. Integrity We will deliver on our word and deliver transparency even when it is uncomfortable. Client driven The client is always first. The client’s success and full satisfaction are our first and top priority. Real science All claims to be supported by scientific data.

Le statine infatti sebbene siano altamente efficaci per tenere sotto controllo la colesterolemia, possono talvolta compromettere il buon funzionamento dell’apparato muscolo-scheletrico. Tale effetto sembra dipendere da una riduzione delle riserve endogene di coenzima Q10, un nutriente essenziale per la produzione di energia cellulare.✨ 
Con Vitasperse®Q10, Giellepi offre una soluzione innovativa e clinicamente validata per massimizzare l’aderenza ad una terapia con statine.
✔ + 13% dei livelli plasmatici di CoQ10 durante co-somministrazione con statine
✔ + 29% Clinical Index Score (sintomatologia muscolare)
✔ Riduzione significativa > di 2 punti sul dolore (VAS)

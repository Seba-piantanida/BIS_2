Per maggiori dettagli, leggete il nostro comunicato stampa:👉 http://bit.ly/2POkP33 Timoteo Di Maulo, CEO di Aperam, ha commentato: 
"Il contesto produttivo europeo è molto simile al 2020, ma con una durata molto più lunga. Il 1° trimestre ha segnato il 7° trimestre consecutivo di recessione per l'industria dell'acciaio inossidabile. Siamo lieti di aver differenziato in anticipo la nostra catena del valore. La divisione Recycling, la silvicoltura, le leghe e la distribuzione sostengono il gruppo durante il basso ciclo dell'acciaio inossidabile. La nostra Leadership Journey 5, incentrato sul miglioramento del mix e sulla riduzione dei costi, ripristinerà la redditività e la capacità di generare cash per Aperam. Il successo è già visibile nella nostra performance ESG. Con meno di 280 kg di CO2e per tonnellata di acciaio Aperam ha già superato nel 2023 il suo ambizioso obiettivo per il 2030 ed è uno dei migliori produttori a livello globale". Aperam 121.694 follower 6 giorni Modificato #Aperam publishes today its first quarter 2024 results. For more details, read our Press Release: 👉 http://bit.ly/2POkP33 . Tim Di Maulo , CEO of Aperam, commented: 
“The European manufacturing environment resembles 2020 but with a much longer duration. Q1 marked the 7th consecutive recessionary quarter in the stainless steel industry. We are glad to have differentiated our value chain early. Recycling, forestry, alloys and distribution support the group through the low stainless cycle. Our Leadership Journey 5 focus of mix improvement and cost reduction focus will restore Aperam’s profitability and cash generating ability. Success is already visible in our ESG performance. At less than 280 kg CO2e per tonne of steel Aperam surpassed already in 2023 its ambitious target for 2030 and is a best in class producer globally.” Read the full Press Release aperam.com 6 Consiglia Commenta Condividi Aperam Italy 2.032 follower 1 settimana Segnala post Le tecnologie dirompenti che stanno definendo la rivoluzione della #mobilità e dei trasporti introducono nuovi requisiti per i materiali.

Aperam 121.694 follower 2 settimane Modificato 👉 https://bit.ly/3w742zL #Aperam Announces the Publication of its Sustainability Performance Report for 2023 called ‘made for life’. As a CO2e footprint (Scope 1+2) leading company in our market, we are proud to present the improvement of our results, from 0.32 in 2022 to 0.28 tCO2e/tcs in 2023, ahead of our 2030 goal and well below the sector’s average. 
This good performance is based on Aperam’s differentiated value chain with three strategic advantages: 
✔ Our optimised use of steel scrap in Europe, made possible by the integration of the former ELG, now Aperam Recycling; 
✔ The charcoal that replaces extractive coke into our Brazilian Blast Furnaces ; 
✔ The sequestration capabilities of our FSC©-certified forestry management. The repeat A- rating we received from CDP Climate confirmed the consistency of our approach. 

“2023 could have only been a typical, low cycle year but the geopolitical tensions, natural disasters and cost of living crises resulted in higher costs and sluggish demand for Aperam. Agility being one of our key values and sustainability our early and long-lasting differentiation strategy, in 2023, we remained committed to our social, environmental and societal responsibilities. For 2024, we will continue to grow Aperam Recycling, BioEnergia and Recyco organically, while looking to uncover new sustainable business models”.

💼 Durante l'incontro abbiamo approfondito temi cruciali come la valutazione delle prestazioni, il potenziale e i piani di sviluppo. È stato fantastico vedere l'entusiasmo e l'interesse dei ragazzi mentre discutevamo di queste importanti tematiche.

👏 Un ringraziamento speciale alla prof.ssa Elena Tosca per aver reso possibile questo scambio di idee e per averci dato l'opportunità di interagire con gli studenti.

🍀 Auguriamo ai ragazzi tutto il meglio per il loro percorso accademico e professionale. Siamo certi che con il loro talento e la loro determinazione raggiungeranno grandi traguardi nel campo delle Risorse Umane. #AperamItalia #GiovaniProfessionisti #HR #Formazione #LaureaMagistrale 23 1 commento Consiglia Commenta Condividi Aperam Italy 2.032 follower 1 mese Modificato Segnala post 🐣 🌷 I centri servizi di Massalengo e Podenzano di #Aperam Italia augurano a tutti Buona Pasqua! 18 Consiglia Commenta Condividi Iscriviti ora per vedere cosa ti stai perdendo Trova persone che conosci presso Aperam Italy Sfoglia le offerte di lavoro consigliate per te Visualizza tutti gli aggiornamenti, le notizie e gli articoli Iscriviti ora Pagine affiliate Aperam Attività minerarie Pagine simili Aperam Attività minerarie Aperam Germany Attività minerarie Haan,  Nordrhein-Westfalen Aperam no Brasil Attività minerarie Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais Aperam Ibérica Attività minerarie Viladecans, Catalonia Outokumpu Fabbricazione di metalli primari LSI Lamiere Speciali Inox S.p.A.

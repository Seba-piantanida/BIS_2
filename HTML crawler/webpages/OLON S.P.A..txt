This new molecule is added to Olon’s record of 200 generic APIs and over 450 Drug Master Files. 
Thanks to a consolidated #R &D strategy supporting medical and scientific advances in targeted drugs and significant investments in #research , the group's API portfolio has grown significantly over the years, with considerable diversification in the areas of oncology. #Trilaclilib — the first injectable adjuvant for cancer therapy to become part of Olon's portfolio — was developed in amorphous form using a proprietary process.

“We pursue diversification from different perspectives: classes of molecules, volumes, therapeutic areas. In this case, we diversified the technology and pharmaceutical form to offer an alternative to oral solids for this specific adjuvant therapy,” said Luisa Volpati , BU Director Generics. “We started with solid in-house expertise and knowledge; in fact, we have quite a large list of injectables, many of which are for cancer treatment, such as rubicins, bendamustine, melphalan and clofarabine” #activepharmaceuticalingredients #pharmasupplychain 64 Consiglia Commenta Condividi Olon 48.911 follower 1 settimana Modificato Segnala post WE ARE ALL SET UP FOR #CPHI North America

As a European API manufacturer, #Olon is proud of representing our industry, as member of EFCG - European Fine Chemicals Group These are the words of our President @Roberta Pizzocaro for her speech during the Ceremonial Launch
"The key issues in highly regulated sectors such as medicines are the lack of EU-driven regulations and incentives, the lack of incentives to innovate in greener processes, and the lack of a sustainable business case for many mature but critical medicines. Addressing these issues head-on, through a common and focused EU ambition, should fulfill the rightful expectation of EU citizens to have uninterrupted access to affordable and available critical medicines" #criticalmedicines #shortage 124 Consiglia Commenta Condividi Olon 48.911 follower 2 settimane Modificato Segnala post The time is now, medicines shortages are severely impacting the lives of EU citizens.

Since years, we’ve embarked on a sustainability journey to reduce impact on environment, with great focus on energy, greenhouse gases, water, and waste. Within our long-term program to reduce the energy consumption by installing renewable energy systems in our global manufacturing network, we’ve finalized the installation of a photovoltaic system of over 4MW in Rodano (Milan) Olon site. This is a major step forward along the transition to sustainable energy sources.
 
With an estimated production capacity of 6.5GWh/year, the photovoltaic system will allow the generation of clean electricity with ZERO CO2 emissions. This achievement will significantly reduce the ecological footprint of our operations, allowing us to yearly save the emission of tons of CO2 - 2000Ton/ year. This initiative marks our concrete commitment towards the decarbonization of production.
 
We will continue to actively pursue projects and initiatives that promote environmental sustainability and the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are confident that our collective efforts will lead to tangible results in the fight against climate change

This new molecule is added to Olon’s record of 200 generic APIs and over 450 Drug Master Files. Thanks to a consolidated R&D strategy supporting medical and scientific advances in targeted drugs and significant investments in research, the group’s API portfolio has grown significantly over the years, with considerable diversification in the areas of oncology. Trilaclilib — the first injectable adjuvant for cancer therapy to become part of Olon’s portfolio — was developed in amorphous form using a proprietary process. “We pursue diversification from different perspectives: classes of molecules, volumes, therapeutic areas. In this case, we diversified the technology and pharmaceutical form to offer an alternative to oral solids for this specific adjuvant therapy,” said Luisa Volpati, BU Director, Generics. “We started with solid in-house expertise and knowledge; in fact, we have quite a large list of injectables, many of which are for cancer treatment, such as rubicins, bendamustine, melphalan and clofarabine.” Trilaciclib is an intravenous cell-cycle inhibitor that transiently maintains immune cells and haemopoietic stem and progenitor cells in G1 arrest. By protecting the immune cells and bone marrow from chemotherapy-induced damage, trilaciclib has the potential to optimise antitumour activity while minimising myelotoxicity.

Era il 1999. Il giorno dopo Roberta Pizzocaro mise piede alla Olon, a Rodano, nel Milanese e non ne è più uscita. Dall’ufficio acquisti su su per la scala gerarchica fino ad arrivare, nel 2016, alla presidenza di un gruppo che oggi vale oltre 500 milioni di euro di fatturato e che lei stessa non esita a definire «uno dei leader mondiali nella produzione di principi attivi per l’industria farmaceutica». Una storia di successo basata su due percorsi paralleli: da un lato la continua ricerca di innovazione, di processo, di prodotto. Dall’altra l’attenzione al mercato, con una crescita spesso realizzata per linee esterne. Sono undici le acquisizioni realizzata da Olon. «Inizialmente – dice Roberta Pizzocaro – guardavamo ad aziende in difficoltà, che nascondevano un valore che poteva venire meglio espresso. Poi ci siamo focalizzati su aziende con un elevato contenuto innovativo, che potessero aggiungere qualcosa di importante al nostro gruppo, anche come piattaforme tecnologiche». Due su tre Oggi Olon è partner delle più note Big Pharma mondiali, a cui negli anni più recenti ha saputo affiancare piccole e medie aziende ad elevato contenuto innovativo, che ne stanno spingendo il fatturato. La pandemia ha visto Olon in prima fila: due dei tre farmaci per la cura del Covid-19 contengono principi attivi sviluppati dall’azienda della famiglia Pizzocaro. Francesco Pizzocaro, fondatore di un gruppo che, oltre a Olon, comprende Fidia farmaceutici e Sir resine Il ruolo della famiglia è stato fondamentale nello sviluppo dell’azienda. Il fondatore è Francesco Pizzocaro, 84 anni, ex impiegato di secondo livello della grande Montedison che, nel 1984, si è messo in proprio con un socio e ha iniziato a produrre principi attivi conto terzi, fino ad arrivare ad acquisire la Fidia farmaceutici di Abano Terme e a sbarcare nel mondo delle resine con la Sir di Macherio. «Aver realizzato undici acquisizioni – spiega la presidente Pizzocaro – è stato come lavorare in undici aziende diverse, che hanno portato culture e visioni originali del business . Dove la famiglia è stata centrale e ha avuto un ruolo importante è stato nella continuità della visione strategica. Lavorare con Big Pharma presuppone un rapporto di fiducia elevato. La supply chain è particolarmente complessa, il track record conta molto. Ecco, la gestione famigliare, la responsabilità personale, la prospettiva lunga hanno giocato a nostro favore nel rapporto con le grandi aziende, che sapevano di poter contare su Olon. Mio marito, Paolo Tubertini, è amministratore delegato di Olon dal 2003 e ha avuto un ruolo importante nella crescita del gruppo, mio padre è ancora vicino all’azienda e la più grande delle mie tre figlie, prossima alla maturità, ha manifestato la volontà di intraprendere un percorso di studi nelle biotecnologie. Ancora non significa nulla, ma noi ci siamo…». Proprio le biotecnologie sono al centro del progetto di sviluppo del gruppo. «La crescita della popolazione mondiale ha evidenziato possibili criticità nella catena del food che sono state ingigantite dallo scoppio del conflitto ucraino – dice la presidente di Olon -. Per questo abbiamo aumentato il nostro impegno nella ricerca di proteine alternative rispetto a quelle di origine animale, puntando molto sulla fermentazione. Al settore stiamo dedicando la maggior parte di un programma di investimenti da 100 milioni di euro che è la prova più evidente della nostra volontà di continuare un percorso autonomo di crescita, ancora una volta con grande attenzione a cogliere ogni opportunità per crescere per linee esterne». Investimenti Due settimane fa il gruppo milanese ha annunciato un investimento da 10 milioni di euro per la creazione di un centro di ricerca interamente dedicato ai principi attivi. Si tratta di un R&D Hub che occuperà una vasta area all’interno del quartier generale di Rodano che sarà dedicata a laboratori di ricerca applicati allo sviluppo di processi per la produzione di Api ( active pharmaceutical ingredients ) che rappresenteranno l’ hub di un sistema che già conta sette centri di ricerca. Cinquanta i nuovi ricercatori, che si aggiungeranno ai trecento già al lavoro. Nascerà così un innovativo modello di global R&D networking nel quale le alte specializzazioni di processi specifici verranno connesse, condivise e applicate a tutto il networking del gruppo. Se il biotech è il settore sotto osservazione, gli Stati Uniti sono il mercato a cui Olon guarda con più attenzione. La presenza Oltreoceano del gruppo milanese si sostanzia in un ufficio commerciale nel New Jersey e in un impianto di produzione situato in Ohio, vicino a Cleveland. Le collaborazioni con le aziende statunitensi sono numerose, dalle Big Pharma alla più piccola ma attivissima Veru. «Il percorso evolutivo della globalizzazione produttiva ha subito delle importanti variazioni ed essere vicini ai nostri partner d’affari è diventato sempre più necessario. Per questo cercheremo di crescere ancora anche in Nordamerica, magari acquisendo qualche realtà locale. È nella nostra storia, sappiamo come si realizzano questo tipo di operazioni e vogliamo continuare a crescere. La dimensione è un fattore importante nella competizione internazionale e un gruppo integrato come il nostro, che ha interessi che vanno dalla produzione di principi attivi alle resine, fino al pharma vero e proprio, non può smettere di crescere e di assorbire ogni innovazione». È la ricetta del fondatore, pronta per essere tramandata alla terza generazione. © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA Iscriviti alla newsletter "Whatever it Takes" di Federico Fubini .

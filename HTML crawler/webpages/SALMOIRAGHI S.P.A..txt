Dall'inizio del 2017 è di proprietà della Luxottica di Leonardo Del Vecchio . Indice 1 Storia 1.1 Salmoiraghi 1.2 Viganò 1.3 Fusione dei marchi 1.4 Passaggio alla Luxottica 2 Influenza culturale 3 Note 4 Collegamenti esterni Storia [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] Salmoiraghi [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] Le origini dell'azienda risalgono al 1865 , anno in cui a Milano è fondata da un capitano del Genio appassionato di ottica, Ignazio Porro , la scuola-officina La Filotecnica , specializzata nella costruzione di strumenti topografici. Angelo Salmoiraghi , un ex-allievo chiamato da Porro a dargli una mano, trasforma a partire dal 1880 quel che era un laboratorio in un'attività inizialmente artigianale specializzata nelle lenti e nelle applicazioni ottiche. [2] Dal 1906 fino alla Seconda Guerra Mondiale , l'azienda prende il nome di Filotecnica Salmoiraghi diventando industria e ampliando la produzione con strumenti per la matematica, il disegno, l'astronomia, la meteorologia, l'idrometrica, l'ottica tradizionale, la navigazione marittima e la navigazione aerea. Il marchio Salmoiraghi si diffonde così in Italia e all'estero. Tra la Prima e la Seconda Guerra Mondiale, grazie ai successi tecnici ottenuti nel campo della strumentazione aeronautica, l'azienda entra nella sfera del gruppo IRI , rafforzando così i rapporti con i maggiori produttori del mondo. Apre un negozio nel centro di Milano, in Galleria , e poi un altro a Roma in Piazza Colonna . [2] Durante il secondo conflitto mondiale l'azienda diventa un obiettivo bellico e gli stabilimenti in via Raffaello Sanzio a Milano vengono bombardati, ma già al termine delle ostilità l'azienda riprende la produzione adeguandosi alle nuove esigenze e creando una fitta rete di negozi con il marchio Salmoiraghi: negli anni sessanta sono già 25. Viganò [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] Parallelamente alla storia di Angelo Salmoiraghi, si sviluppa quella di Angelo Viganò , un commerciante, che nel 1880 apre il suo primo negozio di ottica in Piazza Cordusio a Milano. [2] Nel 1919 gli subentra il figlio Gianni, che istituisce l'esame gratuito della vista e, nel 1933 , amplia il negozio di Piazza Cordusio creando l'" Istituto Ottico Viganò " di tre piani. Apre poi negozi a Genova, Roma, Bari, Salsomaggiore. Solo nel dopoguerra Viganò, ancora solo una insegna commerciale, diventa marchio di fabbrica quando nel 1951 nasce a Rovereto la Meccanoptica Leonardo per la produzione di occhiali, dalle lenti alla montatura. Fusione dei marchi [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] Negli anni settanta entrambe le aziende incontrano momenti difficili. Nel 1969 scompare Gianni Viganò mentre la famiglia Salmoiraghi deve vendere dei negozi. E tra il 1974 e 1975 le due società entrano nel più grande gruppo europeo operante nel campo dell'ottica, il britannico Dollond & Aitchison . [2] Da due realtà in precedenza concorrenti, prende così vita la Salmoiraghi & Viganò. Per 25 anni la nuova insegna convive pur essendo sottoposta ad una serie di passaggi di mano: prima alla General Optica Internacional Sa, una società che opera in Spagna e Portogallo , quindi al gruppo De Rigo che la acquisisce quando nel 2000 compra proprio la concorrente General Optica per poi vendere subito la Salmoiraghi & Viganò ad un gruppo di investitori istituzionali guidati da Arca Merchant. [3] Dal 2002 la società diventa di proprietà dell'ingegner Dino Tabacchi , [4] il più giovane dei quattro fratelli Tabacchi che hanno sviluppato e portato ai vertici mondiali del settore degli occhiali la Safilo . Nel 1999 c'è disaccordo tra i fratelli Tabacchi che hanno visioni strategiche diverse sul futuro della Safilo. Dino preferisce così uscire dall'azienda di famiglia ed entrare nella Salmoiraghi & Viganò che ha 180 negozi di ottica ed è anche cliente della Safilo. [5] Sotto la sua guida e quella dei figli Edoardo e Emanuele Maria, la società arriva ad avere negli anni circa 1800 dipendentii e 400 negozi di proprietà e in franchising in Italia. Passaggio alla Luxottica [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] All'inizio del 2017 nuovo passaggio di proprietà: la Salmoiraghi & Viganò passa alla Luxottica di Leonardo Del Vecchio che già nel 2012 era entrata nell'azienda acquisendo il 36% del capitale sottoscrivendo un aumento di capitale per 45 milioni. [6] Nuovo amministratore delegato è Leonardo Maria del Vecchio. [7] Influenza culturale [ modifica | modifica wikitesto ] Gli occhiali Viganò entrano nel repertorio del poeta e attore meneghino Giovanni Barrella : "Ne pod pù de vedegh no per mett i occiaj del Viganò" (Non vedo l'ora di perdere la vista per mettere gli occhiali del Viganò). [2] Per Salmoiraghi ci pensa invece Trilussa senza ricorrere questa volta al dialetto capitolino: "Quattro fate e quattro maghi/ fan le lenti a Salmoiraghi/ per vedere chiaro e tondo/ quel che accade in questo mondo/ attraverso quei cristalli/ verdi, rossi, neri, gialli/ puoi scrutare nettamente/ sia le cose che la gente/ contemplandoti il creato/ nel colore che ti è grato".Esiste anche la Brivio e Viganó trasportatrice del gelo.

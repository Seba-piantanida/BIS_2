e soluzioni cliniche per il trattamento di malattie cerebrali e
tumorali. L’Azienda sviluppa dispositivi medici all’avanguardia e
sistemi di pianificazione delle radiazioni per radioterapia e
radiochirurgia. In Italia Elekta ha una sua branch dal 1997, aperta a seguito
dell’acquisizione da parte di Elekta AB della divisione radioterapia di
Philips. In questi anni sono stati installati centinaia di sistemi in
tutt’Italia, ogni anno nel nostro paese circa il 40% dei pazienti che
ricevono cure radioterapiche vengono trattati con l’aiuto delle
tecnologie Elekta. L’organizzazione tecnica di Elekta S.p.A. si occupa
di tutto ciò che vien definito “after sales”: dalle installazioni al
service, dagli aggiornamenti ai training. In questi due decenni tale
organizzazione è notevolmente cambiata, adeguandosi alle nuove
tecnologie, alla complessità della gestione, al supporto dei nuovi
sistemi ed alle nuove esigenze dei clienti utilizzatori. Le nuove
tecnologie, l’informatica, il supporto in via remota, sono tutti
elementi che hanno contribuito alla crescita e alla modernizzazione del
Service Elekta. La componente informatica è sicuramente la parte dei
prodotti Elekta che ha avuto maggiore sviluppo soprattutto negli ultimi
anni. Le nuove metodiche MRL Unity, Studio Brachy, AI Intelligence e
HDRS per i fasci esterni stanno di fatto segnando un nuovo orizzonte per
la cura al paziente. Elekta S.p.A.

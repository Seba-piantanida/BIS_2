From increased production to reduced costs to improved environmental performance, our solutions for water-intensive industrial operations create value for every customer. Case history Improved Environmental Performance We enabled a paper mill to increase its annual revenue by $1.3 million by reducing its COD load. View more In light of growing concerns about climate change, pollution and natural resource depletion, green business practices have become a strategic necessity that demands a rigorous, disciplined approach. Mines, paper mills, refineries and other industrial operations must find innovative ways to improve their environmental performance as measured by a number of indicators, such as water consumption, energy use, and airborne and water emissions. At Solenis, we help our customers develop sustainable business practices every day — read about one example in the paper industry. Case History When a European packaging paper producer tried to increase its production, its effluent treatment plant proved too small to cope with the increased chemical oxygen demand (COD) load. Faced with either uprating the effluent plant at a significant capital expense or limiting production in order to stay below the discharge consent limits, mill management contacted Solenis for help. After conducting a thorough system audit, the Solenis team proposed that the mill trial an innovative chemical program that fixes starch fragments and other organic fines to the paper fibers, which in turn removes those elements from the effluent. The mill agreed to evaluate the program and shortly after the trial startup the COD load was reduced by more than 11 percent and the mill’s paper machines were ramped up to full capacity, thereby maximizing paper production. Due to the success of the trial, the mill permanently adopted the Solenis program, which is marketed as “Biobond. Improving the Sustainability of Paper SM program. To date, the Biobond program has enabled the mill to increase its annual revenue by approximately $1.3 million. Case history Improved Asset Protection A chemical processing plant used our XD3899 microbiocide to control corrosion rates and extend equipment life. View more In industries with harsh operating environments, maximizing the life expectancy of equipment at the lowest possible cost is a strategic priority. This often requires a multi-pronged approach that involves advanced water treatment chemistry, preventative maintenance and resource conservation. See how Solenis helped a chemical processing plant protect its assets — and its bottom line — with an innovative program to fight corrosion and biofouling. Case History A chemical processing plant located in the Southwest United States was using a stabilized phosphate treatment program, with acid for pH control and bleach for microbiological control, in its cooling towers. Unfortunately, high copper corrosion rates were impacting process refrigeration reliability. While reducing corrosion was the priority, the plant also wanted to reduce metals discharge to its effluent plant and eliminate the use of acid. After conducting an audit of the plant’s cooling water system, the Solenis team recommended the combined use of an alkaline corrosion inhibitor and Biosperse TM XD3899 microbiocide, a mild oxidizing biocide that effectively controls biofilm formation. The new treatment program reduced copper corrosion rates by more than 75 percent, extending the life of the plant’s capital-intensive equipment. The program also enabled the plant to reduce metals discharge in the effluent, reduce chemical treatment costs by $30,000 per year and reduce water use by 22 million gallons per year. Case history Improved Data Visibility We helped an oil refinery improve its data visibility, which led to improved efficiency and extended equipment life. See more chemical treatment results. View more A manufacturing or heavy industrial facility is much more than machines and equipment. It's also a vast reservoir of data generated by sensors, analyzers and human workers. When manufacturers are able to acquire, analyze and respond to all of that data, they elevate information into something far more valuable — business intelligence. See how Solenis helped an oil refinery improve its data visibility and, as a result, its competitiveness. Case History An oil refinery in the Gulf Coast region of the United States was experiencing high iron and surface pitting of carbon steel. The cause of these problems was identified as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC). After identifying low-flow heat exchanger velocity as a contributing factor, Solenis recommended that the refinery employ an OnGuard TM 2-plus control system to model the operating conditions of a challenged lean amine cooler in the sulfur recovery unit. Data from the OnGuard system revealed that the heat exchanger was leaking amine, which was contributing to microbiological growth. The system also quantified the effect of biofouling on corrosion and heat transfer. Armed with this information, the refinery was able to take corrective measures that resulted in a 66 percent reduction in carbon steel pitting and a 52 percent reduction in carbon steel corrosion. The refinery was also able to increase heat exchanger efficiency, extend heat exchanger bundle life by 30 percent and eliminate unscheduled downtime, all of which strengthened the refinery’s competitive position. Case history Reduced Costs By using our filler-fiber optimization program, a paper producer cut its annual costs by more than $1 million. View more For any business, regardless of sector, protecting the bottom line is the highest priority. One of the easiest ways to increase profitability is to reduce operating costs, though it sometimes requires an external partner that can help you see your business in new ways and that can provide a novel solution. Learn how Solenis brought together insights and innovative technology to help a paper producer reduce its manufacturing costs without affecting end product quality. Case History Due to tough market conditions and high competitive pressure, a European paper producer was challenged to reduce its operating costs on a 640-ton-per-day machine producing high-quality copy grades. Replacing high cost virgin fiber with a lower cost filler was a key initiative. Previous efforts to increase filler content either reduced productivity or reduced tensile strength significantly, leading to quality issues, both of which limited the mill’s ability to improve its operating costs. Solenis evaluated the mill’s system and recommended a new filler-fiber optimization program called OptiFill SM . Since permanently converting to Solenis’ OptiFill program, the mill has increased its filler use from 20 to 25 percent and has realized significant cost savings — more than $1 million annually — without compromising quality or productivity. Case history Improved Profitability A mining operation used our antiscalants to reduce downtime for cleaning, boosting annual profitability by $2 million. View more Profitability is the most important measure of the success of a business. A business that isn’t profitable won’t survive, which is why taking actions that improve the bottom line is one of the most important tasks of managers running complex manufacturing and industrial operations. Discover how Solenis helped a mining operation improve its profitability with advanced chemistry and deep applications expertise. Case History A gold mining operation in the Western United States was having difficulty regulating the acid and lime feeds in its process water system, leading to scale deposition in the water lines. Solids in the reclaim water were also contributing to the deposition problem, which required significant downtime for removing scale. The mine contacted Solenis for help because every hour of lost production cost the mine approximately $70,000. After conducting a thorough system review, the Solenis team recommended that the mine implement a new treatment program using Zalta TM antiscalants. Despite pH swings and variable process flow rates, the Zalta antiscalant program significantly reduced scale deposition in the water lines and reclaim water. As a result, downtime for cleaning was reduced by more than three hours per month, which improved the mill’s profitability by more than $2 million a year. Case history Increased Productivity Our creping adhesives helped a mill increase its machine speed by 7 percent, boosting productivity and revenue. View more Being productive is all about bringing products to market more quickly. Sometimes this requires investing in new equipment. The ultimate goal, however, is to produce more in less time without making a capital investment. This involves collecting and analyzing data, making effective decisions and streamlining processes. Learn how Solenis helped a tissue manufacturer boost its productivity and improve the quality of its finished product with innovative chemistry. Case History A North American tissue mill wanted to increase the speed of its light dry crepe (LDC) Yankee machine by increasing steam pressure and temperature. Unfortunately, the mill’s existing creping program became too hard and too adhesive at high temperature and low creping moisture. After contacting Solenis for help, the mill agreed to trial Crepetrol TM 9200 creping adhesive. Designed specifically for LDC machines making bath or facial tissue, Crepetrol 9200 creping adhesive provides a soft, controlled adhesion Yankee coating at high temperature with good moisture control. Taking advantage of these characteristics, the mill was able to increase the speed of its machine by 7 percent and improve the hand-feel properties of its tissue. Ultimately, the mill increased its productivity and enjoys the potential to increase its annual revenue by more than $2 million.

View more Being productive is all about bringing products to market more quickly. Sometimes this requires investing in new equipment. The ultimate goal, however, is to produce more in less time without making a capital investment. This involves collecting and analyzing data, making effective decisions and streamlining processes. Learn how Solenis helped a tissue manufacturer boost its productivity and improve the quality of its finished product with innovative chemistry. Case History A North American tissue mill wanted to increase the speed of its light dry crepe (LDC) Yankee machine by increasing steam pressure and temperature. Unfortunately, the mill’s existing creping program became too hard and too adhesive at high temperature and low creping moisture. After contacting Solenis for help, the mill agreed to trial Crepetrol TM 9200 creping adhesive. Designed specifically for LDC machines making bath or facial tissue, Crepetrol 9200 creping adhesive provides a soft, controlled adhesion Yankee coating at high temperature with good moisture control. Taking advantage of these characteristics, the mill was able to increase the speed of its machine by 7 percent and improve the hand-feel properties of its tissue. Ultimately, the mill increased its productivity and enjoys the potential to increase its annual revenue by more than $2 million. Case history Improved Environmental Performance We enabled a paper mill to increase its annual revenue by $1.3 million by reducing its COD load. View more In light of growing concerns about climate change, pollution and natural resource depletion, green business practices have become a strategic necessity that demands a rigorous, disciplined approach. Mines, paper mills, refineries and other industrial operations must find innovative ways to improve their environmental performance as measured by a number of indicators, such as water consumption, energy use, and airborne and water emissions. At Solenis, we help our customers develop sustainable business practices every day — read about one example in the paper industry. Case History When a European packaging paper producer tried to increase its production, its effluent treatment plant proved too small to cope with the increased chemical oxygen demand (COD) load. Faced with either uprating the effluent plant at a significant capital expense or limiting production in order to stay below the discharge consent limits, mill management contacted Solenis for help. After conducting a thorough system audit, the Solenis team proposed that the mill trial an innovative chemical program that fixes starch fragments and other organic fines to the paper fibers, which in turn removes those elements from the effluent. The mill agreed to evaluate the program and shortly after the trial startup the COD load was reduced by more than 11 percent and the mill’s paper machines were ramped up to full capacity, thereby maximizing paper production. Due to the success of the trial, the mill permanently adopted the Solenis program, which is marketed as “Biobond. Improving the Sustainability of Paper SM program. To date, the Biobond program has enabled the mill to increase its annual revenue by approximately $1.3 million. Case history Improved Asset Protection A chemical processing plant used our XD3899 microbiocide to control corrosion rates and extend equipment life. View more In industries with harsh operating environments, maximizing the life expectancy of equipment at the lowest possible cost is a strategic priority. This often requires a multi-pronged approach that involves advanced water treatment chemistry, preventative maintenance and resource conservation. See how Solenis helped a chemical processing plant protect its assets — and its bottom line — with an innovative program to fight corrosion and biofouling. Case History A chemical processing plant located in the Southwest United States was using a stabilized phosphate treatment program, with acid for pH control and bleach for microbiological control, in its cooling towers. Unfortunately, high copper corrosion rates were impacting process refrigeration reliability. While reducing corrosion was the priority, the plant also wanted to reduce metals discharge to its effluent plant and eliminate the use of acid. After conducting an audit of the plant’s cooling water system, the Solenis team recommended the combined use of an alkaline corrosion inhibitor and Biosperse TM XD3899 microbiocide, a mild oxidizing biocide that effectively controls biofilm formation. The new treatment program reduced copper corrosion rates by more than 75 percent, extending the life of the plant’s capital-intensive equipment. The program also enabled the plant to reduce metals discharge in the effluent, reduce chemical treatment costs by $30,000 per year and reduce water use by 22 million gallons per year. 1 2 3 4 5 6 See all Close Close We're here to help.

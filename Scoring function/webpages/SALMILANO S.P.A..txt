Salmilano – Salmilano Home About us Products Contact Menu Home About us Products Contact Home About us Products Contact Menu Home About us Products Contact Previous slide Next slide ABOUT US Salmilano, situated at the heart of Brianza – an area traditionally known for its high-quality production of cured meats- has been operating in the food industry for over 90 years, producing a full line of cold cuts and specializing in the production of salami and mortadella. Having been given the CEE IT1503L mark, our products can be exported to Europe and many other countries worldwide (North America and South-East Asia). In the last few years, we have been investing at a technological and production level: we have added new state-of-the-art machineries to the already existing facilities, increasing the potential output of our company. The optimization of the production units has centered around the objective of producing high-quality cured meats that are, at the same time, good value for money. Obviously, thanks to our solid experience and tradition, we manufacture our products, even though using modern machinery, always respecting in full the principles of the oldest and most traditional production methods. That is why we can supply third-party buyers, but we are also able to produce our own branded meats and sell them through the most popular distribution channels.

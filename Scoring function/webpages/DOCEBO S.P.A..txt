Claudio Erba ha fondato nel 2005 Docebo, piattaforma di formazione digitale a distanza, utilizzata da 1,600 aziende in 68 paesi. (Courtesy Docebo) Articolo tratto dal numero di dicembre 2019 di Forbes Italia. Abbonati. ‚ÄúIn Brianza, se non sei un imprenditore, a scuola di solito ti picchiano‚Ä¶‚Äù. Tra il serio e il faceto Claudio Erba ci porta cos√¨ alle origini del suo successo. Docebo , la ex startup da lui fondata nel 2005 nella casa di famiglia vicino alle curve dell‚Äôautodromo di Monza, √® una delle belle storie del 2019: un‚Äôimpresa con testa e cuore italiani che si √® quotata alla Borsa di Toronto, raccogliendo 75 milioni di dollari. ‚ÄúIo ti insegner√≤‚Äù, dice il nome latino, e infatti Docebo √® una piattaforma di e-learning, formazione digitale e a distanza ovviamente, utilizzata da 1.600 aziende in 68 paesi, da Amnesty International a Intesa Sanpaolo: la dimostrazione di quel che possono fare le tecnologie digitali applicate alla formazione aziendale. Come si fa a creare una multinazionale della formazione, quasi 300 dipendenti, fatturato attorno ai 40 milioni con obiettivo 100 entro il 2021, uffici in Europa, Asia e Nord America, partendo da Biassono? Per Claudio Erba, 46 anni, il primo ingrediente √® proprio lo stile brianzolo: ‚ÄúTesta bassa e lavorare. Pochi aperitivi e focalizzazione sul business‚Ä¶‚Äù. E poi c‚Äô√® la svolta internazionale, un po‚Äô cercata, un po‚Äô dettata dai limiti del mercato italiano. Quando sono arrivate le buone notizie dal Canada, qualche investitore a cui si era rivolto in passato Erba, senza successo, ha fatto outing sui social: ‚ÄúAbbiamo sbagliato valutazione, soprattutto abbiamo sbagliato a non comprendere che Claudio fosse un imprenditore con grandissima potenzialit√†‚Ä¶‚Äù. Cosa che invece √® accaduta oltreoceano, visto che sulla societ√† hanno investito due importanti fondi canadesi e che oggi il 70% del fatturato √® generato in Nord America, con gli Stati Uniti a farla da padrone. Claudio, c‚Äô√® un po‚Äô di amarezza per non essere stato compreso in casa? L‚Äôamarezza ce l‚Äôhanno gli altri, non io. Non sono entrati, quando Docebo valeva meno. Noi siamo brianzoli nel sangue e pensiamo a lavorare. Certo qualche supporto in pi√π in Italia avremmo potuto averlo, ma adesso c‚Äô√® qualcuno che si dovrebbe mangiare le mani. D‚Äôaltro canto per noi √® stato un c‚Ä¶ gigantesco il fatto che mi abbiano rimbalzato: non saremmo riusciti a fare quello che abbiamo fatto, perch√© sono le situazioni di stress che ti portano ai grandi cambiamenti. Come comincia il tuo percorso di imprenditore? Ho sempre voluto fare l‚Äôimprenditore, era qualcosa che si respirava in casa, durante le vacanze scolastiche lavoravo con mio padre. Poi ho cominciato a fare esperimenti con Internet nel 1996, ho vissuto tutta la bolla d‚Äôinizio secolo ed √® stato un bene, perch√© non si impara dai successi ma dai fallimenti. Con Docebo ho cominciato nel 2006, due anni dopo la nascita di Facebook, quando la bolla era ormai dimenticata ma in Italia ci si piangeva ancora addosso. Quando √® arrivata la svolta internazionale? Fino al 2012 Docebo era una srl che fatturava 1 milione di euro. Se sei un‚Äôazienda italiana, √® impossibile riuscire a fare come negli Usa, cio√® crescere con il mercato interno: devi necessariamente andare all‚Äôestero. Quello italiano √® piccolo, non ci sono i volumi sufficienti. Noi siamo stati acquisiti da due fondi canadesi, perch√© quando ci hanno visto avevamo gi√† quasi il 50% dei ricavi negli Stati Uniti. Quindi √® possibile per una startup italiana o europea sfondare nel mercato nord americano? S√¨, ma il problema √® arrivarci con un business model convalidato: non √® facile e non accade spesso. Il paradosso √® che per Docebo √® stato pi√π facile e veloce scalare, crescere, con un solo ufficio negli Stati Uniti che nel mercato europeo dove devi lavorare per mercati diversi. Entrare in Gran Bretagna, Francia, Germania √® molto pi√π complicato e richiede pi√π tempo: dinamiche culturali, norme e regole di procurement sono molto diverse. Senza dimenticare le barriere linguistiche‚Ä¶ Che cosa c‚Äô√® nel 2020 di Claudio Erba e di Docebo? Con la quotazione in Borsa nessuno √® uscito, i fondi hanno un lock-in (periodo di blocco, ndr) di 18 mesi e anche il management √® superblindato. Il mio lock-in √® di 36 mesi: questo per dimostrare al mercato che abbiamo una visione lunga.¬†Adesso stiamo lavorando tantissimo con l‚Äôintelligenza artificiale. Pensiamo che pu√≤ aiutare moltissimo a innovare la formazione, che √® ancora molto tradizionale. √à un viaggio lungo, siamo solo all‚Äôinizio e ultraeccitati dalle opportunit√† che si aprono. Ci vediamo tra sette anni, perch√© i nostri azionisti non hanno fretta Claudio, dove vivi adesso? Casa mia √® Macherio, Monza e Brianza, anche se viaggio 10 volte l‚Äôanno negli Stati Uniti. Finora ha funzionato e, quando posso, mi porto in giro anche mia figlia, che ha cinque anni. Non hai mai pensato di trasferirti l√¨? No, mai. In Nord Europa ci sono minori opportunit√† ma si vive meglio. A me piace il mio giardino‚Ä¶ E quando ho tempo studio francese, leggo di tutto, vado in mountain bike e faccio il prato. Dove lo trovo un altro posto come quello della mia Brianza? ¬© RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA Per altri contenuti iscriviti alla newsletter di Forbes.it CLICCANDO QUI .

July 1, 2023, Innomotics will operate in Germany as a legally separate,
wholly owned subsidiary of Siemens AG. The global carve-out is on track; to
be largely completed by October 1, 2023 Innomotics’
management team will comprise Michael Reichle (CEO), Christoph Salentin (CFO)
and Hermann Kleinod (CTO) A new, leading
motors and large drives company will be called Innomotics. Under this name,
Siemens is combining its business activities in the areas of low- to
high-voltage motors, geared motors, medium-voltage converters and motor
spindles. The portfolio includes an innovative solutions and digitalization
portfolio and a broad range of service offerings. The related businesses were
previously assigned to the units Large Drives Applications and Digital
Industries and to the legally separate Siemens companies Sykatec and Weiss
Spindeltechnologie. Effective
July 1, 2023, Innomotics will operate in Germany as a legally separate
company, with operational headquarters in Nuremberg. The carve-out in Germany
will be completed effective the same date. The designated management team
comprises Michael Reichle (CEO), Christoph Salentin (CFO) and Hermann Kleinod
(CTO). The global carve-out is to be largely completed by the start of the new
fiscal year on October 1, 2023. “We’re
convinced of the new company’s future success. The combined strengths of its
individual businesses and the power to act independently will enable Innomotics
to unlock significant value for its customers, leverage its growth potential
and thus ensure its success going forward,” said Ralf P. Thomas, CFO of Siemens AG. “With its
size, its broad portfolio and our highly motivated people, Innomotics will be a
trailblazer in the market and capture a leading competitive position. We’ll
profit from the strong growth potential driven also, in particular, by the
sustainability-oriented demand for more efficient electrification and energy
consumption in industry and society. I’m convinced that Innomotics will provide
us with the optimal setup to leverage this potential,” said Michael Reichle,
designated CEO of Innomotics. Motors and
electrical drive systems are Innomotics’ business and passion. The name Innomotics
combines the promise of innovative power with the experience and reliability of
150 years in motor manufacturing. In the
future, Innomotics will continue to collaborate closely with other Siemens
businesses through partnerships in the areas of technology and sales and in
trade relationships. Innomotics – Launch of a new leading motors and large drives company Share Video Player is loading.

Innomotics to realize growth potential and thus secure the company’s future market
success as a trailblazing specialist for motors and large drives. As part of
its new setup as a separately managed legal entity, Innomotics has presented
its new company logo. The new brand emphasizes that the company is geared
toward technology and innovation, and it places the focus on Innomotics’ team
of people. In addition, with its new “Time for a new green” brand image, Innomotics
is well positioned to shape and leverage the key market trends –
decarbonization and digitalization – in the industries it serves. The Innomotics
portfolio comprises products, systems, complete solutions, and services. The
company uses this portfolio to help its customers improve the efficiency levels
of their plants, employ these assets more effectively and thus abate emissions
and preserve valuable resources. These capabilities are not only available for new
plants, but also for the maintenance, repair and retrofitting of existing
plants. With these offerings, Innomotics enables customers in all industries to
boost energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gases and minimize the carbon
footprints of plants. In addition,
Innomotics will work together closely with other Siemens businesses in the future,
too. This collaboration will, for instance, take the form of product
partnerships in the areas of technology, development and sales as well as
within the framework of supply-and-service contracts. “Our new
brand stands for our aspiration of being a leading innovator in the motor and
large-drive business and expresses the way we view ourselves as a company that
maintains close customer proximity and has more than 150 years of history. With
highly efficient, electric large-drive systems, we can replace conventional
systems that are less sustainable. In this way, we can then help our customers
reduce their greenhouse gas emissions – especially in areas where very high
levels of carbon emissions are still being generated today,” said Michael
Reichle, CEO of Innomotics. Reichle sees
growth potential in fields of development such as hydrogen production, onshore
power connections for offshore platforms and ships, and the future-oriented
area of water supply and water treatment. “We’re very
pleased that – under the new name as of July 1, 2023 – the highly motivated
people employed at our company are joining us on our journey into a future with
diverse growth perspectives. With more than €3 billion in revenue, we can point
to impressive volume and have an ideal setup for expanding our leading position
within the field of competitors,” said Christoph Salentin, CFO of Innomotics. Motors and
electrical large-drive systems are Innomotics’ business and its area of
expertise. The name Innomotics combines the promise of innovative strength and
reliability with the experience and dependability gained from 150 years of
experience in manufacturing electric motors and converters. This aspiration is
also reflected in the company’s slogan, “ redefining reliable motion for a
better tomorrow. ” For this press release PDF Download Brochure Innomotics Follow us on Twitter @siemens_press Siemens AG (Berlin and Munich) is a technology company focused on industry, infrastructure, transport, and healthcare.

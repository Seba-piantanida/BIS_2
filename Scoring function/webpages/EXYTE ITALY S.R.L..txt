Its headquarters are located in Stuttgart (Germany). Exyte's core business includes solutions for the semiconductor , life sciences and chemical industries as well as Data centers . [3] The planning and design of high-tech production plants (especially cleanrooms ) are the company's main focus. Exyte headquarters at Stuttgart , Germany Cleanroom for microelectronic manufacturing The company was founded in 1912 by Karl Meissner and Paul Wurst. [4] For the first 50 years of its existence, Meissner + Wurst mainly produced extraction units, fans and equipment for ventilation technology. [5] In the 1960s, Meissner + Wurst established itself as a pioneer in the development of cleanroom technology. [6] Since the 1990s, the company expanded worldwide by extending its business areas, founding new branch offices and acquiring companies. [4] Jenoptik took over Meissner + Wurst in October 1994 and merged it with Zander Klimatechnik AG from Nuremberg in August 1998 to form M+W Zander. [7] [8] The building services engineering division was spun off from the group in a management buyout under the name M+W Zander Gebäudetechnik GmbH in 2004 and was renamed Caverion Deutschland GmbH in February 2007. [9] In 2005 the Swiss investor Springwater Capital took over M+W Zander, [10] and in 2008 the facility management division was transferred to HSG, which belongs to the Bilfinger Group. [10] [11] Since then, the company has operated under the name of M+W Group, or M+W for short, and is 100% owned by the Austrian holding company Stumpf Group since 2009. [10] [12] The Exyte Group was established in 2018 from a reorganization of the M+W Group . [3] The core businesses (solutions for the semiconductor , batteries, [13] biopharma and Life sciences as well as services for Data centers ) were bundled within the Exyte Group, while all other business activities, which are mainly related to energy projects, are still conducted under the brand name M+W Group. [3] In 2018, the company announced its plans for a public listing and that a larger minority stake would be sold via an IPO . [14] This IPO was postponed in October of the same year due to unfavorable market conditions. [15] In November 2022 BDT Capital Partners agreed to acquire a significant share of Exyte. [16] In March 2024, it was announced Exyte had acquired the Phoenix, Arizona -headquartered delivery systems and contract manufacturing services company, CollabraTech Solutions for an undisclosed amount.

Founded in 2003 by Emilio Fedeli, thanks to his ten-year experience gained in Montedison (later Agrolinz) of Castellanza (VA) and with the collaboration of some fundamental “adventure companions”, from an initial bet it soon transformed into a reality capable to offer services with a high-quality standard and extreme flexibility.
In few years, Eurofed has carved out its own well-defined space and position in the national market, being able to exploit its deep knowledge of this market to achieve important goals and become a real strategic partner for its customers and suppliers.
Eurofed
has grown and changed over the years; Emilio passed away in 2013 and the affection showed by many customers, suppliers, and partners, who have become True Friends over time, gave further proof of the goodness and genuineness of his principles and his way of acting and living. In life and work.
His son Marco had a good fortune and the opportunity to support him for several years and thus learn the right way to move in the world of Italian industry, values ​​that allowed
Eurofed
to become the concrete reality it is today.

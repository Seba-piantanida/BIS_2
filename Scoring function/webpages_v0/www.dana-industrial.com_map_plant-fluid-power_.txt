Fluid Power
is the hydraulic division of Dana Off-Highway  Drive and Motion  Technologies and is the result of the acquisition by Dana of the Brevini Fluid Power business.
Brevini
Fluid Power was established in 2003 through the merger of several companies
active in the hydraulic sector for over forty years. The challenge began in
1973 with the birth of SamHydraulik in 1973, followed by Hydr-APP in 1974. The
company grew over the following decades with the addition of Aron and Brevini
Hydraulics.
The product range expanded through acquisition of VPS in Bologna and OT OilTechnology in Parma. In 2009, acquisition of BPE allowed Brevini Fluid Power to start supplying clients with electronic controls. The Fluid Power division has headquarters in Reggio Emilia, with production units in Europe and China, and a direct presence all over the world with its
service and assembly centers
, ensuring valuable proximity to the customer.

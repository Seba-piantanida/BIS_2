All-round design solutions that provide complete furnishings, suitable for environments that enhance the sophisticated linearity that makes a product pure in its essential nature.
Fabrics
Our collections of fabrics and leathers offer an extremely wide selection of colors, textures and patterns to enrich and decorate all the areas of your home. Threads give life to skillfully woven fabrics and leathers are tanned by expert craftsmen to guarantee the highest quality.
Finishes
Craftsmanship, reflections, surfaces and care for details are the keywords for the finishes proposed by Meridiani. The careful research on materials and the skills of our artisans give life to an ample selection of finishes that make every single product in our collection unique.
Material inspiration
Materials are the protagonists of the “Meridiani Materials” video installation. A tale of handcraft, reflections, texture, and attention to details told through production pictures directly shown on the finished products and the surfaces of which they are made of.

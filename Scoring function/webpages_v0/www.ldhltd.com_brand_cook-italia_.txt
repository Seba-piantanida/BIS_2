Our full range is made in Italy with Italian ingredients by Italian family companies with generations of experience and expertise.
Our products taste authentically Italian because they are: grown, prepared and packed in Italy to give your cooking the true flavour of Italy.
The brand was launched as Cook Italian in 2010. Our pasta and our tomatoes are grown and packed in Italy by the Italian family companies who are the key owners of LDH, and their passion for our products and for Italian food is evident in the quality and authenticity of every product in our range.
In 2016, when we asked shoppers if our packaging reflected our Italian provenance, we found that the new design communicated ‘Italian’ so much better than the current design. We also noticed that many people call us Cook Italia so we checked that too. So now we’re called Cook Italia!
As we say; FOR TRUE ITALIAN FLAVOUR WHEN YOU COOK ITALIAN …. COOK ITALIA!

Chopped strand mat m6 x1
OCV ITALIA
Italy
M6X1 chopped strand mat represents a compelling solution for large and thick part manufacturing when high productivity is required in hand layup or closed mold processes.
EASY HANDLING AND MOLDABILITY
Optimized chop length mix provides superior dry tensile strength while bringing good conformability to contoured molds.
HIGH PROCESS EFFICIENCY
Fast wetthrough and low resin pickup combined with excellent handling properties in dry and wet conditions. This makes the product an ideal choice for large and thick parts production with dry and wetcarrying process.
ENHANCED SERVICE LIFE
Compared to standard Eglass, Advantex® glass helps with enhanced service life in applications facing corrosion.
HAND LAY UP  CLOSED MOLDS
M6X1 mat is designed for use with polyester, vinyl ester resin systems inhand layup or closed mold applications including automotive parts, boats, chemical tanks and pools. (Picture copyright nostal6ie, shutterstock.com. For application illustration only.)

Chopped strand mat m705/m705x1
OCV ITALIA
Italy
M705 chopped strand mat represents a compelling solution to hand lay up high glass content and thin laminates balanced with good mechanical properties.
EASY HANDLING & MOLDABILITY
Optimized chop length mix provides good confirmability to complex contoured molds.
PROCESS EFFICIENCY
Fast wetting and quick air release help reduce the labor required to roll out the part.
BALANCED PERFORMANCES
Moderate impregnation speed reduces resin consumption, resulting in thinner laminate with high glass content, and improved mechanical properties.
ENHANCED SERVICE LIFE
Compared to standard Eglass, Advantex® glass helps with enhanced service life in applications facing corrosion.
M705 mat is designed for use with unsaturated polyester, vinyl ester resin systems in hand layup applications including automotive parts, boats, chemical tanks and pools.

News
Time passes and epochs chase each other, style changes and copies contemporaneity. Everything stems from a need that pulsates and expands the boundaries of the past. It expands and contracts like a breath: patterns, dictates, rules and cultures are broken and reinvented to excite and revive.
Elegant evolution of a classic legacy.

Bathroom furniture and accessories designed and manufactured entirely in Italy.
Gaia‚Äôs creations are born from a design concept based on meticulous attention to detail and finishes and the selection of exclusive quality materials and components.
Our furnishings are conceived, designed and manufactured by placing the customer at the centre of every process, who takes a leading role in every phase of our work. This is why all products are modifiable and customisable to suit every need. We are proud to emphasise our Italian character and to contribute to creating a value made in Italy.

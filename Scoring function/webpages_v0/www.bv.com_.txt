Featured Projects
GWRS Final Expansion Fortifies Orange County’s Water Supply
The Groundwater Replenishment System in southern California produces high-quality recycled water used to recharge the Orange County Groundwater Basin – the primary potable water supply for more than 2.5 million people. Designed by Black & Veatch, the final expansion project added 30 million gallons a day (mgd) to the system’s capacity, upping its total to 130 mgd, and for the first time enabled 100% of the area’s reclaimable wastewater flows to be recycled.
Gas-Fired Power Plant Project Defies Challenges to Deliver Safe, Reliable Power
Alabama Power delivers on its commitment to bring customers safe, reliable, and resilient power. In November 2023, the utility completed its state-of-the-art combined cycle generation facility, Plant Barry Unit 8 (Barry 8). The combined cycle unit uses Mitsubishi Power’s M501JAC advanced-class combustion turbine technology and can generate up to 727 megawatts (MW) to power more than 200,000 homes
America’s first commercial-scale offshore wind project
Black & Veatch was contracted by General Electric (GE) to perform the port marshalling mechanical and electrical construction for Vineyard Wind, the nation’s first utility-scale offshore wind energy project. Located 15 miles off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, Vineyard Wind will consist of 62 wind turbines that will generate renewable energy for over 400,000 homes and businesses in the area, while significantly reducing carbon emissions. The project achieved “first power” in January 2024.
Nature-Based Project Addresses City’s Top Public Works Priority, Winning Record FEMA Grant
Weekes Wash drains a portion of the Superstition Mountains east of metropolitan Phoenix. The usually dry watercourse cuts through desert foliage and is often defined by flash floods. When heavy storms hit, it all quickly comes out in the wash – floodwater, sediment, debris – with destructive force. In harm’s way is Apache Junction, a growing suburb of approximately 40,000 residents.
National Research Effort Delivers Systematic Approach to Stabilizing the Performance of Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal
Black & Veatch led an investigation by The Water Research Foundation (WRF) into a wastewater treatment configuration shown to improve the performance of enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). Building on knowledge from prior research and existing projects, the investigation established a standard approach to encouraging biomass fermentation in sidestream EBPR, or S2EPBR, systems. From a process engineering perspective encompassing design, operations, and modeling considerations, the research focused on optimizing process stability while minimizing energy costs and enabling decarbonization of the biological nutrient removal process.
Upgrades to Wastewater Treatment Plant Support Millions of Residents in Canada’s Largest City
Toronto Water’s Humber Treatment Plant is Toronto’s second largest wastewater treatment facility, serving a population of approximately 662,000. As part of Toronto’s large-scale Capital Improvements Program, the Humber Treatment Plant - South Plant required upgrades to address aging infrastructure and buildings, optimize operational performance, and address community concerns.

Our activities in Angola
Share
We have been present in
Angola
since 1980, and today we operate through the joint venture
Azule Energy
, the country's largest independent hydrocarbon producer, with the aim of achieving greater
operational efficiency
in exploration, development and production. With Azule Energy, we are also present in the liquefied natural gas sector and in solar energy production, which also contributes to job creation. Together with Angola we are taking steps towards an
fair energy transition
.  We contribute to guaranteeing the
security of energy supplies
and we share
resources
and
technologies
with the country. We leave the people with a good part of the energy we produce together, thus expanding the
access to energy
. We contribute to
socio-economic development
, with diversified initiatives in the fields of medicine, agricultural education, vocational training and entrepreneurship.

How we operate in the country
Working with Azule Energy to accelerate resource development
Through the joint venture created with British Petroleum (BP), activities in the area focus on the development of hydrocarbon resources, with the
East Hub & West Hub projects.
The
Caraculo
plant is under construction in the southern-central part of Angola, the first
photovoltaic power plant
in the country. The project contributes to the reduction of diesel consumption for electricity generation, supporting the
diversification of energy
in Angola. In terms of environmental benefits, the Caraculo photovoltaic plant will be able to avoid 50 KtCO
2
eq of climate-altering emissions per year.
A study is being conducted with the National Oil and Gas Agency (ANPG) and Sonangol on the cultivation of castor beans, on degraded land which is not in competition with the food sector, for the production of
biofuels
.
We have launched various initiatives for
promoting schooling
, providing school materials and encouraging pupils to read. We support the project promoted by
HALO Trust
which trains teams of female miners to clear land of unexploded devices, creating new job opportunities among the
female population
. We have installed solar systems and implemented
sanitary
and vaccination campaigns also through
Eni Foundation
.

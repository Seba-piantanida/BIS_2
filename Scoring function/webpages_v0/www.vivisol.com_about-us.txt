Our sustainability model
The spread of chronic illnesses and increasing need to transfer care from hospitals to the home is forcing national healthcare services to adopt new organisational models to reduce waste and ensure patients receive appropriate care. Here at Vivisol, we ensure we take charge of patients using a treatment model which is sustainable for the healthcare sector. For this reason, we take various factors into account in our research and development projects, both for new and consolidated products:
Compliance
The patient is an active and decisive party in the success of home treatment. Accordingly, suitable therapeutic compliance is needed to ensure the care received is effective, and that resources are optimised.
Follow up
Monitoring over time ensures early diagnosis and is a means of prevention which benefits patient health and public healthcare resources.
Efficiency
Efficient processes make it possible to achieve more with the same resources, or ensure service levels are the same even when the resources used are reduced. Efficiency is key for ensuring the success of every service.
Cost effectiveness
Health is increasingly seen as a primary asset. The goal of healthcare systems is to provide the best possible level of care, with real benefits which are in proportion with the resources used to achieve them.

Code of Ethics
Engaging in ethical conduct in our interpersonal relations with staff, clients, suppliers and our stakeholders is one of our six founding values. We were one of the first Groups in the sector to adopt an Ethical Code of Conduct, which obliges all the Group’s employees, including co-workers, consultants and suppliers, to be familiar with, distribute and respect the rules of the Code.

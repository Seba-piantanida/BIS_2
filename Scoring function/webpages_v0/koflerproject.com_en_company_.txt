Without recourse to false modesty we can safely say that, with the skills we have acquired down through the generations, we supply custom-made furnishings which are nothing short of perfect.Our company was founded on three pillars: Consultation, planning and production.
Consultation is grounded in experience, expertise and an eye to the future.Planning is based on a wealth of ideas, analysis and commitment.Production is the result of precision, form and function, all created with top-quality selected materials.And as if that weren’t enough – assembly and after-sales care count among our company’s greatest assets.

How do you tell a story? We make it short and snappy, and offer you an insight into the history of our 60-plus years as a company in words and pictures. Come and see the roots which created our concept of quality today, and the role that a simple chair played in the tale.
We look back with fondness on the year of 1954, when our grandfather Heinrich Kofler founded the company. A cooper by trade, his first commission was a chair. Just one simple piece of furniture. Word spread quickly in the village as to its perfection, and with the founder’s acumen, love of quality and skilled craftsmanship, other commissions were soon to arrive. It was not long before more helping hands were required, and the company began to expand. In 1991, Kofler passed into the trusted hands of Heinrich’s son, Albert; in the meantime Daniel and Hannes - the third generation - had also begun to work in the company, respecting tradition successfully while laying the foundations for a promising future.

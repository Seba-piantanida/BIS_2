Italy is a crucial hub for intercontinental and maritime links as well as trade in the Mediterranean. With our high-frequency shuttle trains on a total of seven routes, we offer the full spectrum of transport services. In this way, we connect the economic areas of Italy and Austria with numerous economic centres throughout Europe. And we do so in a manner that is environmentally friendly, safe and reliable. In conjunction with our logistics centres in Santo Stino and Desio, we offer holistic transportation and warehousing logistics, including the final distribution throughout Italy, from a single source. Pre- and post-run included.
Through its geographical position in the heart of Europe, the Adriatic port of Trieste is one of the main transhipment points for Central Europe and serves as a hub in land and sea transport. Thanks to our own freight railway, we connect the port directly with economic regions in Central Europe. As a result, we create international connections between overseas and the dynamic market in Central and Eastern Europe.

Systema encompasses more than 15 years of activity, thousands of successfully delivered projects and trusted relationships built. We are a time-tested, seasoned, experienced and loyal team. Most of us, you’ve probably known us for years.
Why Systema?
Strongest international reputation
International Accreditation Services (IAS), our accrediting body, is a signatory to the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (APAC). Systema certifications are therefore the guarantee for organizations that operate on national and international markets and that want an accreditation recognized anywhere in the world. Systema's accreditation is registered with the IAS under the identification code MSCB-173.
Excellence, tailored to your needs
We take on tasks and make commitments, follow procedures and processes, comply with policies, rules, and regulations. But we always take a personalized approach to each project and tailor the certification process to your specific pace and needs.
Performance
We think in priorities and pursue efficiency in achieving concrete results. That's why we design the certification stages to be optimally structured. It is not enough to deliver the best certification services. In the process, we also aim to be as non-disruptive as possible for you and your internal processes, and to help you tick all your business goals.
Quality
We keep our promises again that's why we document every step. We use modern technologies and software; we have developed our own management software to facilitate the certification process. The result: efficiency and a smoother experience interacting with you.
Effective communication
We always provide clear information, we are open, honest, and transparent. We start by detailing the steps and requirements in the certification process, then continue to provide clarity and transparency throughout the process. We believe that regular, constant, and open feedback helps to strengthen the relationship between us and you and to cultivate a relaxed professional climate.
Words of thanks for their professionalism, responsiveness and adaptability to the multitude of ever-changing requirements. You are inventive in solving complex situations simply. The auditors come in, do their job, approaching it in a constructive manner that does not disrupt the continuity of processes in our company. A big thank you!

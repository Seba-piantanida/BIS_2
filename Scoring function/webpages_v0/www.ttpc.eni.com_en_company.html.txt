TThe Trans Tunisian Pipeline Company was established to ensure the transportation of natural gas of Algerian origin from the border between Tunisia and Algeria, at Oued Saf-Saf, to the Tunisian coast, at Cap Bon, where the TTPC transportation system connects to the TMPC submarine pipeline.
Company and History
TTPC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SeaCorridor, a company jointly owned by Eni and Snam, with its registered office in San Donato Milanese, Italy, and has the primary function of transporting gas of Algerian origin through Tunisia.

Transtunisian Pipeline
The TTPC transport system was built to transport gas of Algerian origin to Italy and is the result of agreements between Eni and the Tunisian state in 1977 and renewed in 1991 for the construction of a second line; these agreements were ratified by the Tunisian parliament and have therefore become the law of the Republic of Tunisia.
The TTPC pipeline came into operation in 1983.
In 1994, the first significant expansion of the Transtunisian pipeline was completed, through the laying of a second line and the upgrading of the compression system.
The transit through Tunisia was carried out, in the case of both the first and second lines, under agreements between Eni and the Tunisian State, signed on 25 October 1977 and 6 March 1991 respectively. Following approval by the National Assembly, these agreements became Tunisian state law.
A new agreement was updated, and is the one still in force, in September 2019.

The 231 Model
Legislative Decree No. 231 of 8 June 2001 introduced the regulation of the Administrative Liability of Companies under which they can be held liable, and consequently penalised, for certain offences committed or attempted in the interest or to the advantage of the company by its directors or employees. The liability of the company is excluded if it has adopted and effectively implemented, prior to the commission of offences, organisational, management and control models suitable for preventing such offences ('Model 231') and has established a body responsible for supervising the operation of and compliance with the models ('Supervisory Board').

TTPC has implemented the Guideline on Privacy and data protection adopted by SeaCorridor, a document describing the general principles to be observed for the correct application of the regulations on the protection of personal data and the rules aimed at ensuring, within the company organisation, the correct management of activities relating to the processing of personal data.

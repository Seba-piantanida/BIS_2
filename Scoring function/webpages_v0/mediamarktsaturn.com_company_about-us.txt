Partner and navigator
Consumers live an increasingly digital lifestyle – and consumer electronics has evolved from a luxury into a ‘necessity’. The digital world may be fascinating, but it’s also increasingly complex. At the MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group, we see ourselves as a partner, daily companion and navigator of our customers, and combine digital products and services to create practical solutions.
Powerful brands
Our portfolio of brands and offerings enables us to respond flexibly to the needs of different customer groups and different countries. The company includes the brands MediaMarkt and Saturn, which comprehensively network their more than 1,000 fixed-location stores with online sales platforms. Another important part of our portfolio is our own brands PEAQ, KOENIC, ISY and ok.
A subsidiary of CECONOMY AG, in 2021/22 MediaMarktSaturn and its approximately 50,000 employees generated total sales of about €22.2 billion.

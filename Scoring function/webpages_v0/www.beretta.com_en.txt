BEPLANET
BePlanet is not a slogan nor a logo, but a concrete and tangible commitment in reaching, year by year, outcomes that affect less and less the environment, and yet improve standards of productive quality. It sums up a path that started many years ago, when the strategic goals were nailed down for the reduction of the impact on water, soil, air and energy. BePlanet collects and organises the ventures that Beretta leads every day in order to protect the environment.

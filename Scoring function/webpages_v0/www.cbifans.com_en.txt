Who we are
Passion, technology, innovation for over 60 years.
Our story begins in 1963, when Industrie CBI specialized in fan construction. Fifteen years later, in 1978, CBI Sud was born with a new plant in Frosinone, we are just getting started...
In 1981, it was the turn of CBI Engineering with the Cambiago plant, while the following year, the existing structure in Monza expanded and doubled in size. Rapid milestones lead our Group to a significant presence in Europe with the establishment of CBI Belgium in 1985 and CBI France in 1987.
In the following years, to provide after-sales services during and after the warranty period, CBI Service was established. Its main activities include installation, assistance, commissioning, overhaul and revamping, proactive maintenance, and repairs.
In the 2000s, our group strengthened its presence in Europe with new locations in Belgium (specializing in heavy-duty services, especially for the glass and steel industries), France, and Spain. In 2008, we entered India with CBDoctor, specializing in standardized industrial fans, followed by Turkey in 2012.

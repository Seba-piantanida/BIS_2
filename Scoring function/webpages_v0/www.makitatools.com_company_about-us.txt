It all started with the motor over 100 years ago. Makita Corporation was founded in 1915 as an electric motor sales and repair company. Today, as a global brand in over 40 countries, Makita is an innovation leader, manufacturing best-in-class products at 10 plants operating in 8 countries. The unmatched quality and durability of Makita products is driven by the company’s strong R&D capabilities, and have earned the trust of professional users worldwide. Every day, on jobsites around the world, Makita delivers the power, performance and durability that professional users demand with products that are more compact, have less vibration and feel better.
USA
The Makita U.S.A., Inc. Home Office is located in La Mirada, California, and operates an extensive distribution network across the United States. The Makita Corporation of America is located in Buford, Georgia, and is part of a global network of ten manufacturing and assembly plants in eight nations for Makita products used on job sites around the world. The product development team works closely with engineers on job sites to develop products that meet and exceed the demands of the American contractor.
Makita U.S.A., Inc. operates warehouse and distribution facilities in the following locations: Flowery Branch, Georgia; Reno, Nevada; and Wilmer, Texas. The three facilities also serve as locations for the Makita Innovation Training Center, a hands-on educational experience where contractors and dealers can learn the latest Makita technologies, products and applications.
1915 Founded
It all started with the motor over 100 years ago. Makita Corporation was founded in 1915 as an electric motor sales and repair company. Today, as a global brand in over 40 countries, Makita is an innovation leader, manufacturing best-in-class products at 10 plants operating in 8 countries. The unmatched quality and durability of Makita products is driven by the company’s strong R&D capabilities, and have earned the trust of professional users worldwide. Every day, on jobsites around the world, Makita delivers the power, performance and durability that professional users demand with products that are more compact, have less vibration and feel better.
2004 Brushless Tool
Makita first developed brushless motor fastening tools in 2004 for the defense and aerospace industries. Engineered for extended run time, increased power and speed, and longer tool life, the Makita brushless motor was ideal for precision assembly applications. Makita extended this efficient technology to contractors in 2009 with the industry’s first 18V brushless motor impact driver.
1958 First Power Tool
1958 marked the release of Makita’s first power tool, a portable electric planer. Later that year Makita furthered its position as a specialized manufacturer of electric power tools with the introduction of a portable groove cutter. A Makita electric circular saw and electric drill soon followed in 1962.
2015 Industry Leader
The original Makita Portable Electric Planer released in 1958 was the predecessor to today’s 3-1/4” Planer, which can be found on job sites across the USA and around the world. The engineering and design contrasts between these two planers clearly demonstrate Makita’s ongoing innovation, which brings new and more efficient solutions to address ever-changing job site demands.
1978 First Cordless Power Tool
After 10 years of design and testing to ensure quality, Makita introduced its first 7.2V Cordless Drill in 1978. Significant investments in research and development resulted in increased power and run time, shortened charging time and longer tool life. These same attributes would become hallmarks of Makita cordless tools. By 1987 Makita's line-up of 7.2V cordless consisted of 15 different tools that all used the same battery and charger. A 9.6V line-up was made up of 10 tools.
2015 LXT
®
Reaches 100 Tools
Makita created the 18V Lithium-Ion category in 2005, and today offers the world’s largest cordless tool line-up powered by an 18V slide-style battery. 2015 marks the release of the 100th Makita 18V tool – and they’re powered by the industry’s fastest-charging 18V Lithium-Ion batteries. Makita’s expanding 18V line-up is giving tool users more power, longer run time and superior ergonomics, with more opportunities than ever before to unplug the cord.
Early Production and Assembly
Even as a new company, Makita was quick to incorporate mass production and assembly capabilities that could respond to consumers demands and need for high quality products. By the 1970s Makita had established a strong production base which afforded greater productivity and improved quality control. In 1985 Makita Corporation of America began manufacturing and assembling tools in Buford, Georgia.
Makita Corporation of America
Makita Corporation of America (MCA) is located in Buford, Georgia. As part of the Makita global network of ten manufacturing and assembly plants, Buford is one source Development Team works closely with engineers on job sites to develop products that exceed the demands of the American contractor.

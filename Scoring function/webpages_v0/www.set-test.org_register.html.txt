                  candidate should ensure that the preferred programme(s) is / are selected and paid before the last
                  date.
Indian nationals and NRI candidates shall have to apply under SET/SLAT/SITEEE 2024 to seek admission
                  to the select Undergraduate programmes of Symbiosis International (Deemed University).
A student is eligible to apply as a Non Resident Indian (NRI) if he/she has appeared for either
                  10th or 10+2 (equivalent to the Indian 10th or 12th) examination outside India. It is mandatory
                  for NRI students who have appeared for their 10th standard exam outside India and 12th in India
                  to appear for SET/SLAT/SITEEE as applicable.

Any attempt to impersonate or indulge in any malpractice, identified at any stage of the

                    of Symbiosis International (Deemed University) and may also lead to appropriate legal action as

Indian nationals and NRI candidates shall have to apply under SET/SLAT/SITEEE 2024 to seek admission
                  to the select Undergraduate programmes of Symbiosis International (Deemed University).
A student is eligible to apply as a Non Resident Indian (NRI) if he/she has appeared for either

                  for NRI students who have appeared for their 10th standard exam outside India and 12th in India
                  to appear for SET/SLAT/SITEEE as applicable.
However, OCI/ PIO/ Foreign Nationals are exempted from appearing for SET/SLAT/SITEEE 2024 and have to

                      Bulletin

Any attempt to impersonate or indulge in any malpractice, identified at any stage of the

                    of Symbiosis International (Deemed University) and may also lead to appropriate legal action as
                    deemed fit.

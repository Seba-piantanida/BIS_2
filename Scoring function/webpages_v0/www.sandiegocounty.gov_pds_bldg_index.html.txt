Welcome to Building Division
Storm Recovery Information
The County is here to support all of
  our residents, but we wanted to reach out to those residents who are
  located within the unincorporated areas after these unprecedented
  weather events. High levels of rain along with flooding have caused
  damage to many structures in our communities and you may find yourself
  in need of structural repair or rebuilding after the recent floods.
  The County team is here to support you in those efforts and the Board
  of Supervisors has provided additional support in the permit process
  that may apply to your project.
If you have suffered damage or need to
  do repairs after the recent rain events please make sure to report the
  damage through our Crisis tracking application or online with our
  building services email. If you send us an email make sure to include
  “Flood damage reporting” in the subject line of the email. If you have
  already started the cleanup and have photos please provide those to
  the team when we make contact. We will send out a building inspector
  to collect some basic information and record the damage in our system.
If you are located in the
  unincorporated County we have a program called the Home Owner Relief
  Act that will cover the cost of the building permits for the repairs
  to your home. The Board of Supervisors has also made available funds
  for waiving the permitting fees associated with repairing or replacing
  a retaining wall that failed during the rain event or that failed
  after due to the rain event. The recent event did not seem to cause
  enough damage to replace any of our homes, but if the damage caused by
  the rains does result in a tear-down rebuild, there are funds to cover
  the plan check and permit for your rebuilding efforts.
Many times after a flood you will need
  to replace drywall, insulation, dry out framing with bleach, and
  possibly replace an outlet. If you are just repairing these items it
  does require a permit but that permit is a no-cost, no-plan permit
  that we can process for you online through email. We understand that
  these are trying and costly times to repair your home, and your health
  and safety are the number one priority for our team. Please reach out
  by email or phone if you have any questions about the process or if
  you want to discuss options.

(619) 380-3055
Please see the links below for access to additional resources
  that were provided at our Local Assistance Centers that may help you
  in the process of rebuilding and repairing damage from the floods. We
  are here to support our communities and will be ready to help you as
  you start the process.

ADU Fee Waiver Program Notice:
The County of San Diego trial impact
  fee waiver went into effect on January 9, 2019. This was a five-year
  trial waiver that ended on January 9, 2024.
Plan check fees were waived for
  qualifying projects that started before January 9, 2024. Fees that are
  collected at permit issuance will not be waived if the permit is
  issued after January 9, 2024.
Overview
The County reviews plans to the most recently adopted California
  Building Code, County of San Diego Amended Building Code, the County
  of San Diego Zoning Ordinance and General Plan. We understand that
  staying current with all of these requirements can be challenging and
  that there are portions of each referenced code that can be left to
  interpretation. That is why it is our goal to offer all of our
  customers an opportunity for a second opinion on any correction or
  interpretation that we have made during plan review or over the
  counter. If you as our customer feel that your interpretation of a
  requirement could be interpreted a different way, please ask for a
  second opinion.
Second Opinion
A second opinion is available on any interpretation or correction
  provided and will not affect the level of customer service you
  receive. We ask you to provide your interpretation of the code along
  with any health and safety concerns that the interpretation may cause
  and how this will affect your project. The second opinion will come
  from one of our senior staff or a supervisor who will have a chance to
  take a deeper look at supporting documentation on both sides of the
  issue. This may occur at the counter or require a few days for proper
  research and understanding of the intent of the code in question.
  After your second opinion you can always follow up with our Building
  Official for a final opinion.
The Project Issue Resolution (PIR) Conference
This is yet another opportunity for our customers to have
  interpretations reviewed and heard by Executive Management. A Project
  Issue Resolution Conference is a meeting that includes an applicant,
  our Executive Management team, and County Project Staff to discuss
  issues and identify solutions that were not able to be resolved with
  County Supervisors due to interpretations of code or other unique
  circumstances related to a project. Please

for more information.

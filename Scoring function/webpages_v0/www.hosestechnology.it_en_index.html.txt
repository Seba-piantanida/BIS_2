New implementation in our protection division
Always taking care of the inquiry of our most valuable customers, our PROTECTION division has recently completed the implementation of the brand new BI-FLEXSPIRAL spiral.
Thanks to the particular production technology it is possible to generate a protective spiral of two different colors, produced in HDPE, resistant to low temperatures (- 60 ° c) and with the presence of the particular edge, the spiral can be easily recognizable in the case of particular applications.
PROTUBI-PU-NL
Quality is meeting and exceeding the customer’s needs and expectations and then continuing to improve; that’s the reason why our research and development is a neverending process based on the usage of new raw materials and innovative production techniques.
Today Hoses Technology is proud to introduce in its comprehensive range the new PROTUBI/PU, a brand new specialty polyurethane sleeve, very smooth, compact, streamlined, and highly abrasion resistant.
The PROTUBI/PU has been mainly created for increasing the resistance to abrasion but it also offers an incredible advantage in terms of high temperatures (+ 85° C); last but not least the polyurethane offers great performances when it comes to traction and load.
PUSH-HT/B-R
This new product is mainly designed for molding machines, and is currently managed in red and blue colors, however there are various applications and the range of colors that can be adopted on request.
PUSH HT SAE / 100 R6 (black cover) will also be presented shortly, which will be available from October.

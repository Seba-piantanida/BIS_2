Payments client
"Working with StoneX is a seamless process. My team can go in, initiate transfers, request quotes to see what kind of rate we're going to get, and we know that the money will be there in 72 hours, tops."
Grain farmer
"We have increased our efficiency over 40% as it relates to comparing the StoneX process to the paper-based and spreadsheet-based system we had before."
Risk management and commodities client
"StoneX really understands our business. They understand how we want to operate and what our risk profiles are, so they can ensure that we're doing what we need to be doing from a risk management perspective, and are using the right tools and offering the right products to our farmers to make sure that we're providing value to them."
Grain farmer
"StoneX products are designed by the customer, for the customer. You can combine the infrastructure of StoneX and our global presence with a product that a customer helped design. You catch both sides of the desk and it's a really powerful tool."
Payments client

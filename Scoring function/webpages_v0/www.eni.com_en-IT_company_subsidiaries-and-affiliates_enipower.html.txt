Enipower was established in November 1999. Today Enipower, directly or through its subsidiaries, owns
five power plants
located in Brindisi, Ferrara, Mantua, Ravenna and Ferrera Erbognone (Pavia) and a
co-generation plant
in Bolgiano (San Donato Milanese), with a total operating capacity of around 5.1 GW. This plant fleet puts the company among the top national producers of electricity and makes it the leading producer of technological steam.
More information is available in the

Enipower holds controlling interests in two companies:
Enipower Mantova
, the company that operates the thermoelectric power plant in Mantua (a subsidiary of TEA, active in the field of energy and environmental services);
Società Enipower Ferrara (SEF Company)

Power transformers, born in the USA
The reliability and resilience of the U.S. electric grid are vital for both energy and national security. Large power transformers (LPTs) are critical components, but currently more than 80 percent are imported, with lead times of up to five years. In response to this challenge, Siemens Energy is expanding its manufacturing and service operations in Charlotte, North Carolina.

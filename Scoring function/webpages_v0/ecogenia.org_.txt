Building Greece’s national youth climate corps.
Established in 2021, Ecogenia’s goal is to become a national youth corps, where

We want to provide every young person (18-30 years old) the opportunity to participate in
a year of service
, leading localized change and addressing community needs across the 13 regions of Greece
through a paid service term

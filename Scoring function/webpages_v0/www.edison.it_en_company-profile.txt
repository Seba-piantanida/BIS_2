We are committed to diversify sources and routes of supply for the national energy system safety and competitiveness. We are studying the construction of new infrastructures to import gas and we are developing the first integrated small scale LNG (small-scale liquefied natural gas plants) logistics chain, to support heavy and maritime sustainable mobility. We also manage gas storage and distribution activities.
Families, businesses, public administrations and territories
We focus our strategy on offering innovative services built on the needs of our consumers and stakeholders. We are at their side to offer our expertise, we want to stimulate in them a more conscious and intelligent use of energy and we cultivate relationships made of transparency and trust. Because only together with our customers can we build a future of sustainable energy.

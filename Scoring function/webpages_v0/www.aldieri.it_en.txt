I am very delicate.
I want the right temperature and I can't be tossed around. I'm sick if that happens.

Until yesterday, we were forgotten at the end of the world.

They brought us safe and sound to the parade!
How embarrassing. First delays, inconveniences and forced stops.
Then, well, Aldieri took care of it. I arrived on time for the appointment with the store!

Las Vegas luxury redefined
Colors and textures in The Cosmopolitan's rooms and suites create a calm, comfortable ambiance, and unexpected, inventive details – such as evocative photographs and whimsical wallpaper – create a stylish, contemporary impression. Many of our Las Vegas hotel rooms have large sliding glass doors that open onto oversized private terraces with Las Vegas Strip or mountain views, allowing fresh air and sunlight to flood the indoor spaces.
Marble-floored bathrooms invite guests to relax in deep soaking tubs and enjoy exhilarating rain showers. Each room is outfitted with the latest technology for maximum in-room enjoyment, including sophisticated entertainment systems, plasma-screen televisions that include access to such personal subscription services as Netflix® and Pandora®, high-speed wireless Internet access, and state-of-the-art control panels. Many rooms have wet bars equipped with a sub-zero wine chiller, as well as fountain and city views.

The Cosmopolitan stands for cultivating meaningful awareness, driving sustainable action and setting new standards.

Client testimony at
Le Grand Mello
A totally wonderful place away from it all. We were there a night and a part of a day but felt like we were there for a few days. The venue is fantastic and the grounds are totally amazing and everything has been thought extremly well and the catering was to the highest standard. I have spoken to a couple of my colleagues and passed them the packs I picked up at the weekend and suggested that they consider Châteauform' for their next event when they need to book something special.

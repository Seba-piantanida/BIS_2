It is ugly and disrespectful. And every single one of us have already witnessed a situation like this, right? During the Australian Open last week, before entering the locker room, Roger Federer was stopped by a staff member for not wearing his badge. Yes, Roger Federer. The 20-time Grand Slam winner Roger Federer. Yes, the 310-week leading ATP Ranking Roger Federer. The best tennis player of all times.After being stopped, RF just acted like you would expect him to act. The superstar just stopped, and waited for his crew to catch up with him and flash his badge to the staff member. No bullying, no harassment, no disrespect, no \"do you know who you are talking to\". And we thought we could only learn from him playing on the court. hashtag#tennis hashtag#respect",

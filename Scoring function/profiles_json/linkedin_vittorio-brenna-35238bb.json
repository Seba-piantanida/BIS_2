According to a study of the European Commissionâ€™s Joint Research Centre, covering just 1% of the utilised agricultural area with agrivoltaic systems could result in 944 GW direct current of installed capacity. So, agrivoltaics alone could surpass EU photovoltaic 2030 goals. For Davines Group | Certified B Corp, the use of agrivoltaics represents a highly virtuous solution.Â In our European Regenerative Organic Center, we plan to create a unique platform that combines the production of active organic ingredients, following the principles of regenerative organic agriculture, and the production of electricity via photovoltaic panels on the same agricultural surface. We strive to realize a highly sustainable project to achieve self-production of energy for the Village and the Plant, while carrying on the cultivation of plants of interest for our research activities, through the creation of a cutting-edge architectural facility in harmony with the landscape. hashtag#DavinesGoodLifeForAll hashtag#BCorp hashtag#SustainableBeauty hashtag#davinesgrouppeople hashtag#davinesgroupregenerationAnthony Molet Stefania Bollati Mark Giannandrea Arnaud Goullin Stefano Benetti Laura Gilieri Andrea Mussi Maria Vittoria Mangiarotti sonia ziveri Alessandra Sabellico Paolo Penocchio Paolo Goi Marco Mazzucco",

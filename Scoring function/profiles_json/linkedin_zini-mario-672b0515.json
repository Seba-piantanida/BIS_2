The logistics have been complex and at times challenging, but everything was perfectly delivered! But nothing would have been possible without the unsung heroes behind the scenes! They navigated the whole season with such an enthusiasm, always holding each other’s back, always with a smile on their face, always united as a working family. Together they made it seem so effortless, together they accomplished! They are the best, the epitome of the word TEAM. I will never thank them enough, both the Team on the ground and the one at home for all the hard work put into this with grace and love for what is not a job. It s a passion!

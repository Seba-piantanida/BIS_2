In a Chinese name, the given name is not the first name. The first name is always the family name. It is totally opposite to the western norm.A Chinese name starts with Family name which is normally one Chinese character such as Wang(Áéã), Zhang ÔºàÂº†Ôºâor Li ÔºàÊùéÔºâ. Chinese Family name might be two Chinese characters such as Ou Yang (Ê¨ßÈò≥Ôºâor Dong FangÔºà‰∏úÊñπÔºâ.A typical Chinese given name is normally one (Yan Â≤©in my case) or two Chinese character (such as Da Fa Â§ßÂèëÔºâRule #1It is fine to call the full name (Family name first and then given name).  For example, I will never feel offended if anyone called me Cui Yan. Of course, it might be not so appropriate to call the full name if you want to be very polite or the person is in a higher hierarchy level.Rule #2It is always wrong to call only the given name if the given name is one Chinese character only. (Exceptional case does exist in case such as a spouse wants to call the partner in an intimate way or sometimes a person calls himself in a humble way) For example, the incumbent Prime Minister‚Äôs name is Li Qiang. (ÊùéÂº∫ÔºâYou can call him Li Qiang or Mr Li or Prime Minster Li but you never should call him Qiang.Rule #3It is fine to call the given name if it is combined of two Chinese characters and you two are close (at least not just met). For example, Li Da Fa (ÊùéÂ§ßÂèëÔºâcan be called Li Da Fa or Mr Li. You can call him Da Fa to show that you two are close.Rule #4If the Chinese has an English given name, then the western norm applies. For example, Jack Ma‚Äôs Chinese name is Ma Yun. You can call him Jack or Ma Yun or Mr Ma but you should not call him Yun.Rule #5If the Chinese family name is two Chinese characters, it is quite normal to call this person family name only. For example,  Zhu Ge Liang(ËØ∏Ëëõ‰∫Æ)can be called Zhu Ge.Actually the western media never mess up in calling the names of Chinese politicians, such as Deng Xiao Ping or Mao Ze Dong. But it seems even in the business world after so many years globalization, rules are still not very clear to many. Therefore I ‚Äúmade up‚Äù above rules upon the request of a German colleague.",

This makes us uniquely resilient to tough macroeconomic conditions, as shown by our strong commercial momentum, with our fresh $2 billion contract in Hong Kong being the latest example of it, together with a record order intake of €3.1 billion in water treatment technologies, in which we are the leader. On top of this, the integration of Suez keeps on delivering ahead of schedule, as we have reached our annual target on this front in just 9 months, a great sign of the value that the merger brings to our company and that we continue to manage all of our activities with rigor.We also owe our great results to the dedication of the whole Veolia team and the fact that our activity is deeply meaningful and needed as the demand for hashtag#EcologicalTransformation grows.All of these factors make me extremely confident in our future trajectory and allow me to fully confirm our targets for 2023. We have many more great things to accomplish in the months and years ahead!🔗 https://lnkd.in/ei7dQCFs",

With revenue up +14.2% and current net income up +18.7%, we delivered excellent results showing not only strong momentum, but also the unmatched strength of our value proposition.Even against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, we continued to deliver crucial value to our clients as the demand for hashtag#EcologicalTransformation grows more and more urgent. To me, the best proof of this lies in the many long-term contracts we have won since the beginning of the year to help the world’s leading cities and companies cope with water scarcity, better manage even the most complex kinds of waste, and find alternative sources of energy. These contracts will contribute to our dynamism for many years.Meanwhile, the merger with Suez has surpassed expectations, with 230 million euros of synergies generated already, well ahead of schedule, and our global footprint is getting more and more diversified.More than ever, Veolia is at the forefront of the world’s toughest environmental challenges, and our team’s expertise simply has no equivalent anywhere else. Our ideal positioning and exceptional team put the group on a sustainable growth trajectory that makes me very confident for the future!",

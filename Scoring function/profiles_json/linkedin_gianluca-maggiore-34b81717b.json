    "about": "With a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Business Science, I continued my studies pursuing a Master's degree in Business and Administration, which gave me the opportunity to live in Poland for 6 months, following lessons with professors from all over the world and improving my knowledge of English at the prestigious Faculty of Management of the University of Warsaw.I have always combined work and study, aware that certain skills and soft skills cannot be learned at school, but cultivated over time through concrete experience in different sectors and environments.Currently engaged in Accounting and Tax Consultancy, I bring with me the passion for economics and English, that often in my free time I cultivate accompanied by a good music, another great passion of mine. I am also passionate about Sport, which I keep practicing day by day.",

Did you know that thermoplastics from SABIC can potentially help suppress dangerous thermal runaway events in EV hashtag#batteries?At hashtag#NPE2024, we are releasing test results showing that our flame retardant STAMAX‚Ñ¢ 30YH570 long glass fiber PP resin can help reduce the risk of cell-to-cell propagation leading to thermal runaway.That is exactly the case in the image we show here with cylindrical battery cells arranged within a thermal runaway barrier made of our STAMAX resin. After going through testing (after view), no propagation has taken place from the trigger cells (top left cell and bottom right cell) to the neighboring cells.At the hashtag#SABIC booth (S19005), you can examine a thermoplastic battery module box. Use of STAMAX 30YH570 resin for such an application can provide the thermal barrier and flame resistance capabilities. The key is a resin phase change from solid to liquid and gas that removes heat via latent intumescent capabilities.For more, check out the news announcement (from the link in the Comments).You‚Äôre invited: consult with our hashtag#automotive experts about solutions available under SABIC‚Äôs BLUEHERO‚Ñ¢ electrification initiative.hashtag#automotive hashtag#electricvehicles hashtag#ChemistryThatMatters hashtag#SABICNPE",

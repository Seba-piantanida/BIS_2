Zambon is a wonderful Company which stands on deep roots and solid values, wide open to a promising future. While preparing myself to say goodbye, I realized that what made  the time spent here worth are the people met along the way, their unique stories and their willingness to drive a valuable transformation. From so many I received energy, inspiration, coaching and encouraging support. I am grateful, fulfilled and aware that I got more than what I managed to give in return. Life is a beautiful adventure üçÄ‚ù§Ô∏è",

As a team, we recognized an opportunity to support women and people who menstruate and further our mission to build a better future for female health. Today, we took another step forward by making our subscription offering, Flo Premium, available for free in countries with some of the greatest health needs. With this offering, users will have unlimited access to all¬† product features and content. Flo will continue granting access to Flo Premium to millions of women and people who menstruate in 58 countries over the next year, with the ambition of improving menstrual and reproductive health literacy for people across the globe. We know that access to medically credible information is imperative for women and people who menstruate. And yet, according to research by UNICEF and WaterAid, only 32% of girls in Bangladesh, 66% in Egypt, and 18% in Malawi were aware of menstruation before their first period. 1 in 4 girls in Kenya do not associate menstruation with pregnancy. Another study run in 29 African countries has found that the prevalence of an incorrect understanding of the timing of ovulation phase ranged between 51% in Comoros and 89.6% in Sao Tome and Principe, and that a strong association exists between incorrect knowledge of ovulation and unintentional pregnancy. The list goes on. Flo is in a prime position to make a genuine difference here. We couldn‚Äôt be more thrilled to launch this initiative as we look forward to future efforts to improve access to medically credible information for those who need it most.

I conveyed the message of David A. Sinclair A.O., Ph.D. to see ageing as a disease and therefore to look for prevention and treatment of ageing. My collegues Ilaria Villa, Erik Janssen, Shainoor Khoja and Josep Santacreu Bonjoch made great contributions to make this a memorable and fruitful discussion.

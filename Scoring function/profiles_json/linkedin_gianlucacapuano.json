There is a fundamental difference between ‚Äúfitting-in‚Äù the culture vs ‚Äúbelonging‚Äù to that culture. This difference can cause talented employees to spend time and energy, without achieving the desired results and performance. A thin blurred line marks the border between inclusiveness and (unhealthy) assimilation.This article is worth reading.  hashtag#diversity hashtag#inclusion hashtag#culture hashtag#talent",

Riding on a race track helps me to remain sharp, reactive, present and laser focused on what matters, to have an impact. Learning a new track, a later breaking point or a new lean angle requires dedication, repetition and some good coaching.  I was so happy when my friend Gianni Avallone decided to not race in the last session of the day! Then I asked him: ‚Äúcan you watch me and coach me‚Äù? when you‚Äôre not playing the game, you can take distance and observe from the paddock. There you develop a different perspective. Gaining that perspective can greatly help me to improve my ‚Äúlap time‚Äù.  3 things Gianni told me:  ‚ÄúDraw your own track, on paper‚Äù, before you start riding. In race tracks (and similarly in our lives) there are rules, boundaries and limitations. Regardless, you can draw your own lines, have a plan and act upon it.  ‚ÄúFollow the fast riders, for one or two turns. You can‚Äôt manage for longer‚Äù ‚Äì he said. Learn from others, those who are better than you. Take small steps, then combine everything together and you‚Äôll have the full track in your hands.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at your front wheel. Keep your head up, focus on the next turn and the one after the next‚Äù. Yes, it might be counter intuitive, but looking at the point where you want your bike to go, projecting yourself in 2 turns from the moment, will help improve your effectiveness. Scan the horizon, anticipate.  I was reflecting on these learnings today. Beyond my bike rides. I love asking my team to ‚Äúwatch me and coach me‚Äù. Big thanks to Gianni.

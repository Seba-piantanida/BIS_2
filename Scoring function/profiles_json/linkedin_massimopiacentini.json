Over the past year, Huawei's enterprise business stepped up efforts to develop innovative scenario-based solutions for different industries and create a digital ecosystem that thrives on joint creation and shared success for Huawei, partners, and customers. Despite the burden of export controls on the mobile device part of our consumer business, in 2020, Huawei's carrier business continued to ensure the stable operations of more than 1,500 networks across more than 170 countries and regions, which helped support telework, online learning, and online shopping throughout COVID-19 lockdowns. Working with carriers around the world, Huawei helped provide a superior-connected experience and moved forward with more than 3,000 5G innovation projects in over 20 industries like coal mining, steel production, ports, and manufacturing. #innovation #sharedvalue",

Unlike conventional centrifugal pumps, the Roto-Jet pump will not seize if run dry due to a loss of suction or if operated with a minimal continuous bypass flow against a closed discharge valve.  The wide range of performance obtained with a single-stage pump provides the user with tremendous flexibility. All Roto-Jet models are capable of a wide range of flows and pressures, allowing the pump to meet the demands of changing system requirements.  Roto-Jet pumps provide a more durable solution in demanding high-pressure general industrial and API applications.

The article covers our efforts at Bayer to develop a new herbicide mode-of-action, the first of its kind in over three decades ‚Äì and a possible successor to glyphosate in some segments. The new herbicide is a future option for farmers to control broadacre weed and achieve long-term invasive weed control without the need of ploughing (no-till). Here‚Äôs what you need to know: üë®‚Äçüåæ Farmers in Germany and across Europe need effective herbicides for an integrated weed management approach, today and in the future. Artificial Intelligence helps Bayer design the next generation of crop protection, with sustainability considerations and environmental impact reduction at the core.  üìà Our new herbicide, targeting specific plant proteins, could generate an estimated revenue of EUR 750 million per year. üó∫Ô∏è By the end of the decade, we expect herbicides based on our new molecule to be launched in the first markets. It has shown to be effective in controlling key resistant grasses in research and is an innovative tool farmers desperately need as they shape the future of regenerative agriculture.Here‚Äôs the link to the full article (paywall and German only): https://lnkd.in/egqrz6gm",

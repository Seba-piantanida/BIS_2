Through its MX Academy, Reckitt launched a DDM upskilling programme, in partnership with BCG, to give every marketeer the credentials to move within the digital marketing space and truly unlock their competitive edge! The whole program retraced all the stages of a digital campaign (hashtag#planning, hashtag#activation, hashtag#analysis, hashtag#testandlearn) and honed in on audience-centric comms, digital activation journeys, optimizing & measuring digital campaigns - with the final aim to allow the deployment of integrated engagement strategies that forge deeper connections between our brands and target audiences! And after learning, it was time to practice all together as a team, on real-life case studies and with an exciting final simulation game! A big thank you to our trainers Alex Martin Vivek Salunke Esra Ezibay and to the whole marketing team, for prioritizing learning & making it so much fun!

It was creativity at its best, didn‚Äôt feel corporate and was absolutely fun to watch.2. ‚ÄúBut Seriously though‚Äù - Why We Need To Make People Laugh: a very much needed reminder on the importance of humor in driving great and compelling Comms. It felt refreshing to use Humor as a creative vehicle, something that felt a bit forgotten. hashtag#canneslions70 hashtag#ReckittAtCannes",

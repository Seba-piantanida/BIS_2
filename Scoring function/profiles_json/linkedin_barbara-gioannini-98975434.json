No, you didn't just run with us, you ran for all the children with cancer and their families that we meet every day: you ran to give them a home, to keep them together and to support them with psychological support during all stages of the disease.  For us it was a very strong emotion to see you united and smiling in reaching the same beautiful goal.  €11,074 so far are the funds that you have managed to raise all together for children and their families on Rete del dono. An absolute record for Soleterre at the Milan Marathon!” We as CRS @ ALFA LAVAL join Soleterre and THANK YOU ALL for your support.",

They embody the very spirit of our event and our Group.In memory of our esteemed colleagues, Francesco Cavallaro and Stefano Grandino, we find inspiration. They were courageous pioneers who made pivotal decisions that contributed to reshaping our industry, paved the way towards innovation and enabled us to redefine our organization's market presence earlier this year. The key to overcoming future challenges for our ever-expanding group lies in 'maturity.' Francesco and Stefano passed on their wisdom to those they collaborated with, and now we must combine that wisdom with youthful innovation.Together, day by day, we'll create a future that honors this legacy.

Solutions will be truly sustainable only if also the economics are satisfied: they will give the financial institutions the confidence to invest in these new solutions because they will be viable.

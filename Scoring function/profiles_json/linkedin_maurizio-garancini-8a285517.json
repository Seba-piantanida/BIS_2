So when we found out about the small town called hashtag#Ostana (in the Italian Western Alps) it was very clear that we had to host our community event there. The town of Ostana was able to bounce back from hashtag#depopulation and developed the local economy around tourism and agriculture... All in all, putting its name on the map as a positive example of hashtag#alpinedevelopment. Overall it was a rich 2 days of food, workshops, talking, and consolidating community. A good way to start saluting winter and welcoming spring. ____________Find out more about ➡️ Protect Our Winters Italy Become a member and support the Italian NGO ➡️https://lnkd.in/dC7-u6Rd",

I had to turn around at ~3.000m even if I felt physically and mentally ready to push through. But if you choose the light and fast style to climb such mountains there is always a small border between life and death. So total 360k with 9.649m elevation and only around 2k and ~700m missing - am I unsatisfied or disappointed? NO - definitely not. I tried everything! I fought against myself physically and mentally - even got back into running after a brutal 295k bike ride against heavy rain and wind. But it's never against the mountain or nature. And this is what I (and also we) have to respect! I am so grateful for the support of BOA® and Protect Our Winters Austria especially Michael Schitzhofer, Pol Puig Collderram and Yannick Bonnert.Success lies not just in reaching summits, but in respecting the magnificence of nature. Onward to future heights and new adventures with reverence for the mountains. 🌟🏔️ hashtag#3HighestPeaksProject hashtag#BOAFitSystem hashtag#BOATrailTeam hashtag#GetDialedIn hashtag#lifeworktrailbalance hashtag#POWAustria hashtag#smarterbusiness hashtag#lifeworktrailbalance",

To solve this situation, hashtag#Ortea carried out an analysis of the plant and identified the main cause as the approximately 250 hashtag#voltage hashtag#sags the company's electrical system was subjected to over the course of a year.The proposed solution was to install an Oxygen voltage sag hashtag#compensator.Considering the high number of voltage sags and the relative costs that the customer had to face each year, the technological solution offered by Ortea not only allows a return on investment (hashtag#ROI) in a very short time, but also a constant production flow.‚úÖ A practical case such as this, can be duplicated in various application sectors besides plastics, such as the electronics hashtag#industry, hashtag#food & hashtag#beverage, hashtag#steel mills, hashtag#paper mills, hashtag#petrochemicals, hashtag#automotive, hashtag#medical, hashtag#pharmaceutical, hashtag#datacenter etc.üìå Learn more on Oxygen solution here: https://lnkd.in/dkCXJz4K",

Remo Ruffini, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moncler S.p.A., commented: \"Our Group delivered excellent results in the first quarter of the year. I am particularly satisfied with the very strong double-digit growth achieved in the core DTC channel by both our brands. But I am even prouder of the distinctive brand experiences we created over the past few months, building stronger and stronger connections with our communities. In St. Moritz we brought people from across the globe into the universe of Moncler Grenoble, bringing together high style and high performance, while further authenticating this unique brand dimension. Meanwhile, Stone Island unveiled its new brand manifesto, The Compass Inside, with a signature event in Milan, and launched a new global campaign featuring members of its cultural community. While I am very pleased with the results achieved during the first quarter and very confident in the strong potential of our brands, I am also conscious of the still volatile macroeconomic environment and of the normalisation trends in our sector, which require us to remain prudent and reactive in light of these ongoing uncertainties.\"Read more on https://lnkd.in/d5AHugg2",

And he plans to keep it that way.Ten years after Ruffini‚Äôs blockbuster listing of Moncler on the Milan stock exchange (its stock leapt 50 percent to value the company at ‚Ç¨4 billion) the Italian industrialist is celebrating strong figures for 2023 and a market valuation that‚Äôs now approaching ‚Ç¨20 billion ($22 billion).In its full-year 2023 figures reported Wednesday, Moncler Group revenues rose 17 percent to ‚Ç¨3 billion, while its EBIT margin expanded slightly to 30 percent (second only to Herm√®s among listed luxury firms). Net cash stood at more than ‚Ç¨1 billion.And despite a luxury market that has slowed dramatically following a post-pandemic surge, Moncler‚Äôs growth actually accelerated in the fourth quarter across regions. It‚Äôs a significant feat in a market Ruffini describes as ‚Äúvery volatile, very concerning.‚ÄùThe secret to Ruffini‚Äôs success? Frequent revolution is required to keep standing alone in a luxury arena dominated by bigger groups like LVMH and Kering, he says.Read the full interview by Rachel Sanderson.",

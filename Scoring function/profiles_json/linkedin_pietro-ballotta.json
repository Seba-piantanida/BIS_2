In fact, in the last two winters (seasons 2019-2020 and 2020-2021), thanks to the measures to contain and prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the incidence of influenza has been negligible. This implies also that the population, having been less exposed to the virus, could have a weakened immunity against influenza, especially in children and young people. The fear of experts is therefore that there will be significant outbreaks, especially if new or recently introduced strains emerge.Winter 2022-2023 will be the season of the so called Twindemic?

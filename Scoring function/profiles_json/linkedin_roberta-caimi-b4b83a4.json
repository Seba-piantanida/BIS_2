We had great discussions, built some ambitious plans, and I got to visit the home of our BELOVED brand, Enterogermina!  What an inspiring, constructive, and encouraging visit marked by transparency and co-creation, which has only made us stronger as a team. Bravo to the talented Italian team.  Keep driving, keep challenging the status quo, keep making us inspirationally “uncomfortable”… but above all, keep helping our consumers take better care of themselves...That’s what we are here for 😊Grazie mille Matteo Scarpis Roberto Di Domenico Milena Leone Roberta Caimi Claudia Serafini Francesca Brasi Gabriele Fumagalli Luisa Barba mariachiara uboldi Vittorio Ercoli Silvia Carrera Leonardo Ilha andreina grisolia Vittorio Bonini and to the amazing team in our Origgio Site. hashtag#BetterSelfCare hashtag#inspirationallyuncomfortable hashtag#oneteami",
